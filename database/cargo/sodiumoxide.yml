  title: scalarmult() vulnerable to degenerate public keys
  description: |
    The `scalarmult()` function included in previous versions of this crate
    accepted all-zero public keys, for which the resulting Diffie-Hellman shared
    secret will always be zero regardless of the private key used.

    This issue was fixed by checking for this class of keys and rejecting them
    if they are used.
