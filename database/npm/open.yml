  title: Command Injection
  description: |-
    All versions of `open` are vulnerable to command injection when unsanitized user input is passed in.

    The package does come with the following warning in the readme:

    ```
    The same care should be taken when calling open as if you were calling child_process.exec directly. If it is an executable it will run in a new shell.
    ```
