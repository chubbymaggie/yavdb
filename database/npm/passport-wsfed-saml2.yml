  title: User Impersonation
  description: |
    [`passport-wsfed-saml2`][1] is a ws-federation protocol + SAML2 tokens
    authentication provider for Passport.

    Affected versons if thus package are vulnerable to User Impersonation. A
    vulnerability has been discovered in the Auth0 passport-wsfed-saml2
    library affecting versions &lt; 3.0.5. This vulnerability allows an
    attacker to impersonate another user and potentially elevate their
    privileges if the SAML identity provider does not sign the full SAML
    response (e.g., only signs the assertion within the response).
