  title: Non-Constant Time String Comparison
  description: |
    [`csrf-lite`][1] is a CSRF protection utility for framework-free node
    sites. Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to a timing
    attack.

    While the CSRF protection itself works well and increases security, the
    library uses the built-in string comparison mechanism, `===`, and not a
    time constant string comparison. As a result, the comparison will fail
    faster when the first characters in the token are incorrect. An attacker
    can use this difference to perform a timing attack, essentially allowing
    them to guess the CSRF token one character at a time.

    You can read more about timing attacks in Node.js on the Snyk blog:
