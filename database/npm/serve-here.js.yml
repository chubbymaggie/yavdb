  title: Path Traversal
  description: |
    [serve-here.js][1] is a package that serves static files over HTTP.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Path Traversal. The
    package accepts pathnames of urls and adds it to the web root without
    sanitization. This means that by inputing `../` to the pathname it will
    add it to web root and allows you to traverse to any folder from root.
