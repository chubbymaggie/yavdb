  title: Arbitrary File Overwrite
  description: Versions of `fstream` prior to 1.0.12 are vulnerable to Arbitrary File

    in the system and a file that matches the hardlink will overwrite the system's
    file with the contents of the extracted file. The `fstream.DirWriter()` function
    is vulnerable.
