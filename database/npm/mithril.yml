  title: Prototype Pollution
  description: 'Versions of `mithril` before 2.0.2 are vulnerable to prototype pollution.
    The function `parseQueryString` may allow a malicious user to modify the prototype
    of `Object`, causing the addition or modification of an existing property that
    will exist on all objects. A payload such as `__proto__%5BtoString%5D=123` in
    the query string would change the `toString()` function to `123`.
