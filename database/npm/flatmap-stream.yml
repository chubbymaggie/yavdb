  title: Malicious Package
  description: |+
    `flatmap-stream` is a malicious package which was used in order to steal
    bitcoins from wallets. The malicious code was able to check if the
    `copay-dash` package was installed, and then attempt to steal the
    bitcoins stored in it. It was distributed by hijacking the popular
    `event-stream` package and adding `flatmap-stream` as a dependency.
