  title: Command Injection
  description: Versions of `addax` prior to 1.1.0 are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    The package does not validate user input on the `presignPath` function which receives
    input directly from the API endpoint. Exploiting the vulnerability requires authentication.
    This may allow attackers to run arbitrary commands in the system.
