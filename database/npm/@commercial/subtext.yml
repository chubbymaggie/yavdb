  title: Denial of Service
  description: Versions of `@commercial/subtext` prior to 5.1.1 are vulnerable to
    Denial of Service (DoS). The package fails to enforce the `maxBytes` configuration
    for payloads with chunked encoding that are written to the file system. This allows
    attackers to send requests with arbitrary payload sizes, which may exhaust system
    resources leading to Denial of Service.
  affected_package: "@commercial/subtext"
  vulnerable_versions:
  - "<5.1.1"
  severity: high
  package_manager: npm
