  title: Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol
  description: |
    [`gatsby-cli`][1] is a command-line interface for creating new sites and
    running Gatsby commands.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Resources Downloaded
    over Insecure Protocol due to downloading resources over an insecure
    protocol. It used the git:// protocol to clone repositories, which
    isn\'t safe as it is unencrypted. You can read more about
    `Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)` on our [blog][2].
