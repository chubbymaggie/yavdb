  title: Insufficient Entropy
  description: |
    [cryptr][1] is a simple `aes-256-ctr` encrypt and decrypt module for
    node.js.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficient
    Entropy. If the cleartext contents of encrypted strings are known, it is
    possible to alter the content of the encrypted string without knowledge
    of the key. An attacker could modify encrypted messages in transit
    without detection.
