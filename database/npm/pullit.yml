  title: Arbitrary Command Execution
  description: |
    [`pullit`][1] is Display and pull branches from GitHub pull requests.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. due to an insecure use of the `eval()` function. Node.js
    provides the `eval()` function by default, and is used to translate
    strings into Javascript code. An attacker can craft a malicious payload
    to inject arbitrary commands. `pullit` uses this function in order to
    call git commands, which originate from user input in terms of a
    carefully created remote branch name on GitHub, which pullit pulls
    branch names from.
