  title: Authentication credentails logged in clear text
  description: |-
    Versions of `grunt-gh-pages` prior to 1.0.0 are affected by a vulnerability which may cause unencrypted github credentials to be written to a log file in certain circumstances.

    In the `grunt-gh-pages` deployment scenario where authentication is performed by injecting a github token directly into the auth portion of the URL, `grunt-gh-pages` will write the token to a log file, unencrypted.
