  title: Timing Attack
  description: All versions of `express-basic-auth` are vulnerable to Timing Attacks.
    The package uses nating string comparison instead of a constant time string compare
    which may lead to Timing Attacks. Timing Attacks can be used to increase the efficiency
    of brute-force attacks by removing the exponential increase in entropy gained
    from longer secrets.
