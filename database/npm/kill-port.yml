  title: Arbitrary Command Injection
  description: |
    [kill-port][1] Kills the process running on given port.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command
    Injection. If an attacker can control the port, which in itself is a
    very sensitive value, they can inject arbitrary OS commands due to the
    usage of the exec function in a third-party module.
