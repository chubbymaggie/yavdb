  title: Sandbox Escaping
  description: |+
    \[`safe-eval`\] is a version of `eval`, claiming to be safer.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Sandbox Escaping.
    User input is not sanitized before being passed on to the safeEval
    function. A malicious user could access the object constructors,
    allowing access to the standard library, then escaping the sandbox.

    Proof of Concept:

        var safeEval = require('safe-eval');
        safeEval("this.constructor.constructor('return process')().exit()");
