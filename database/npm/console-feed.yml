  title: Cross-Site Scripting
  description: Versions of `console-feed` prior to 2.8.10 are vulnerable to Cross-Site
    Scripting (XSS). The package fails to properly escape the rendered output. If
    an application uses `console-feed` and a malicious JavaScript payload was passed
    to a `console.log('%_', payload)` call, the package would render HTML containing
    the malicious payload.
