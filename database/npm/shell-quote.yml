  title: Command Injection
  description: |
    [`shell-quote`][1] is an npm package used to quote and parse shell
    commands. The `quote` function does not properly escape the following
    special characters `<`, `>`, `;`, `{`, `}` , and as a result can be used
    by an attacker to inject malicious shell commands or leak sensitive
    information.
