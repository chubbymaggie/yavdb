  title: Malicious Package
  description: 'All versions of `calk` typosquatted a popular package of similar name
    and tracked users who had installed the incorrect package. The package uploaded
    information to a remote server including: name of the downloaded package, name
    of the intended package, the Node version and whether the process was running
    as sudo. There is no further compromise.'
