  title: Man in the Middle (MitM)
  description: "> Versions below 2.9.4 download binary resources over HTTP, which
    leaves the module vulnerable to MITM attacks. It may be possible to cause remote
    code execution (RCE) by swapping out the requested binary with an attacker controlled
    binary if the attacker is on the network or positioned in between the user and
    the remote server.\n> \n> -- [nodesecurity.io](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/162)"
