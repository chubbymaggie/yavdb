  title: Insecure Default Configuration
  description: Affected versions of `airbrake` default to sending environment variables
    over an unencrypted HTTP connection. In scenarios where an attacker has a privileged
    network position, it is possible for them to capture and read these environment
    variables, which may result in leaking sensitive information.
