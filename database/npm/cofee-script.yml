  title: Malicious Package
  description: |
    `cofee-script` is a malicious package that uses [typosquatting][1] to
    bait unknowing users to install them. Packages like this, which carry
    similar names to an original package, offer all the functionality of
    their original, but also include a code snippet that sends your SSH keys
    and bash profile to a remote server controlled by malicious operators
    when installing it.

    This is especially dangerous in production runtime environments, where
    environment variables tend to consist of keys, passwords, tokens and
    other secrets.
