  title: Prototype Pollution
  description: |
    [mixin-deep][1] is a package that deeply mixes the properties of objects
    into the first object.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution
    via merging functions. These functions allows a malicious user to modify
    the prototype of `Object` via `__proto__`, causing the addition or
    modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.
