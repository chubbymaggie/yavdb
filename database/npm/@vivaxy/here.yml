  title: Directory Traversal
  description: "The @vivaxy/here module is a small web server that serves files with
    the process' working directory acting as the web root.\n\nIt is vulnerable to
    a directory traversal attack. \n\nThis means that files on the local file system
    which exist outside of the web root may be disclosed to an attacker. This might
    include confidential files.\n\nMitigating Factors:\nIf the node process is run
    as a user with very limited filesystem permissions, there is significantly less
    risk of exposing confidential/private information.\n\n\nProof of Concept:\n```\ncurl
    \"http://${SERVER_IP}:${SERVER_PORT}/..%2f..%2fetc/passwd\"\n```"
