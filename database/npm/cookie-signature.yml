  title: Non-Constant Time String Comparison
  description: |
    [\'cookie-signature\'][1] is a library for signing cookies.

    Versions before `1.0.4` of the library use the built-in string
    comparison mechanism, `===`, and not a time constant string comparison.
    As a result, the comparison will fail faster when the first characters
    in the token are incorrect. An attacker can use this difference to
    perform a timing attack, essentially allowing them to guess the secret
    one character at a time.

    You can read more about timing attacks in Node.js on the Snyk blog:
