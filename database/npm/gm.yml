  title: Remote Shell Command Injection
  description: |
    The [gm][1] package is the GraphicsMagick and ImageMagick wrapper for
    Node.js. The `compare()` function allows comparing of two images, taking
    as an input argument the path to both images. The function, in versions
    prior to 1.21.1, fails to sanitize the input correctly, making it
    vulnerable to a command injection attack.
