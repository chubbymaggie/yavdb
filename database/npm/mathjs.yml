    [`mathjs`][1] is an extensive math library for JavaScript and Node.js.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution.

    The expression parser in mathjs uses the `eval` and the `new Function`
    methods insecurely which could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary
