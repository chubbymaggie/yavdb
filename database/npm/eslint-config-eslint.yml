  title: Malicious Package
  description: |
    [`eslint-config-eslint`][1] is the ECMAScript scope analyzer used in
    ESLint.

    Version 5.0.2 was identified as malicious after a possible npm account
    takeover. During installation, the malicious code download code from
    `pastebin.com`, then executed it. It sent the contents of the userâ€™s
    `.npmrc` file to the attacker, which typically contains access tokens
    for publishing to npm.

    The malicious package versions have been unpublished from npm.
