  title: Arbitrary Code Injection
  description: |
    [`mongoosemask`][1] is an Express Middleware to filter out Mongoose
    model attributes.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Injection due to unsafe use of the `eval()` function. Node.js provides
    the `eval()` function by default, and is used to translate strings into
    Javascript code. An attacker can craft a malicious payload to inject
    arbitrary commands.
