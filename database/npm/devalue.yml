  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: |
    [devalue][1] is a JSON.stringify, but handles cyclical references,
    repeated references, undefined, regular expressions, dates, Map and Set.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS). Server-rendered HTML will have unescaped route parameters in it,
    allowing to break the page or inject JS code into it when an object key
    contains unsafe characters.
