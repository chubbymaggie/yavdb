  title: Insecure Randomness
  description: |
    [`generate-pincode`][1] is a module for generating random pincodes.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Insecure Randomness.
    It used the cryptographically insecure `Math.random()` in order to
    shuffle the pin code array, which can produce predictable values and
    should not be used in security-sensitive context.

    Typically, `Math.random()` is sufficient for most uses but should be
    avoided for cryptographic use, where the ability to predict the outcome
    gives the attacker a significant advantage.
