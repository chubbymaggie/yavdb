  title: Command Injection
  description: All versions of `wxchangba` are vulnerable to Command Injection. The
    package does not validate user input on the `reqPostMaterial` function, passing
    contents of the `file` parameter to an exec call. This may allow attackers to
    run arbitrary commands in the system.
