  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: |
    [react-dom][1] serves as the entry point of the DOM-related rendering
    paths.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS) attacks.

    This attack is possible only only if the following two conditions are
    true:

    * The application is being rendered to HTML using `ReactDOMServer` API,
      and
    * The app includes a user-supplied attribute name in an HTML tag.

    Server-rendered React apps, which contain the following pattern may by
    affected:

        let props = {};
        props[userProvidedData] = "hello";
        let element = <div {...props} />;
        let html = ReactDOMServer.renderToString(element);

    Given the attacker could influence the `userProvidedData`, they could
    craft an attribute name that would triggler an XSS vulnerability, like:

        ></div><script>alert("hi")</script>`

    Allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary markup:

        <div ></div><script>alert("hi")</script>

    **Note:** This vulnerability affects only some server-rendered React
    apps, which contain a the pattern. Purely client-rendered apps are not
    affected.
