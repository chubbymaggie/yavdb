  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: "> By sending a 256mb websocket message to a uws server instance with
    permessage-deflate enabled, there is a possibility used compression will shrink
    said 256mb down to less than 16mb of websocket payload which passes the length
    check of 16mb payload. This data will then inflate up to 256mb and crash the node
    process by exceeding V8's maximum string size\n> \n> -- [nodesecurity.io](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/149)"
