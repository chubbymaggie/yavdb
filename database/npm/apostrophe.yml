  title: Open Redirect
  description: |
    [apostrophe][1] is a content management system (CMS) for Node.js. It
    supports in-context editing, schema-driven content types, flexible
    widgets and a great deal more. This module contains everything necessary
    to build a website with ApostropheCMS.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect. It
    was possible to convince Apostrophe to redirect to a third-party website
    by appending an escaped URL with a trailing `/` added at the end.
