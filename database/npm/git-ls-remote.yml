  title: Shell Command Injection
  description: |
    [`git-ls-remote`][1] is an npm package used for listing references in a
    remote git repository. Vulnerable versions of the package pass the git
    `url` argument to the `exec` function without sanitisation. An attacker
    can use this to inject malicious shell commands to disrupt server
    operation or obtain sensitive information.
