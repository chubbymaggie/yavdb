  title: Command Injection
  description: All versions of `marsdb` are vulnerable to Command Injection. In the
    `DocumentMatcher` class, selectors on `$where` clauses are passed to a Function
    constructor unsanitized. This allows attackers to run arbitrary commands in the
    system when the function is executed.
