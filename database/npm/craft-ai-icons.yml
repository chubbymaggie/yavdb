  title: Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol
  description: |
    [`craft-ai-icons`][1] is craft ai\'s icon font. Affected versions of the
    package are vulnerable to Man in the Middle (MitM) attacks due to
    downloading resources over an insecure protocol. Without a secure
    connection, it is possible for an attacker to intercept this connection
    and alter the packages received. In serious cases, this may even lead to
    Remote Code Execution (RCE) on your host server.

    You can read more about `Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol` on

    Thanks to [Liang Gong][3] for disclosing this vulnerability!
