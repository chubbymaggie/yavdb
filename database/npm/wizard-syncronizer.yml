  title: Command Injection
  description: All versions of `wizard-syncronizer` are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    The package does not validate input on the `cloneAndSync` function  and concatenates
    it to an exec call. This can be abused through a malicious widget containing the
    payload in the `gitURL` value or through a MITM attack since the package does
    not enforce HTTPS. This may allow attackers to run arbitrary commands in the system.
