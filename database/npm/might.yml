  title: Insecure dependency
  description: |
    Restify has an insecure dependency, node-uuid:

    Math.random was being used as a fall back instead of the crypto API. Math.random is not a cryptographically-secure random number generator.

    Release 5.x will be released shortly: https://github.com/restify/node-restify/issues/1082
