  title: Arbitrary Command Injection
  description: |
    [libnmap][1] is an API to access nmap from node.js.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command
    Injection. If the attacker is allowed to provide the \"range\" field for
    the network scan, they could inject arbitrary OS commands instead of a
    valid IP range.
