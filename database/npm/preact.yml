  title: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  description: |
    [preact][1] is a fast 3kB alternative to React with the same modern API.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of
    Untrusted Data when inserting a JSON object. This vulnerability occurs
    when a JSON object is passed to a HTML document\'s `createElement`
    method without validation, allowing insertion of objects with the same
    attributes.
