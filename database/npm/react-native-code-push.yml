  title: Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip)
  description: "[react-native-code-push][1] provides client-side integration for the\nCodePush
    service, allowing you to easily add a dynamic update experience\nto your React
    Native app(s).\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary
    File Write\nvia Archive Extraction (Zip Slip).\n\n\n\n[1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-code-push\n\\nIt
    is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path\ntraversal
    filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive\nis concatenated
    to the target extraction directory, which results in the\nfinal path ending up
    outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip\nmay hold a file with a \\\"../../file.exe\\\"
    location and thus break out of\nthe target folder. If an executable or a configuration
    file is\noverwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn\ninto
    an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example
    of a zip archive with one benign file and\none malicious file. Extracting the
    malicous file will result in\ntraversing out of the target folder, ending up in
    `/root/.ssh/`\noverwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n    \n    +2018-04-15
