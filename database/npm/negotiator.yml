  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`negotiator`][1] is an HTTP content negotiator for Node.js. Versions
    prior to `0.6.1` are vulnerable to [Regular expression Denial of Service
    (ReDoS)][2] attack when parsing \"Accept-Language\" http header.

    An attacker can provide a long value in the Accept-Language header,
    which nearly matches the pattern being matched. This will cause the
    regular expression matching to take a long time, all the while occupying
    the thread and preventing it from processing other requests. By
    repeatedly sending multiple such requests, the attacker can make the
    server unavailable (a Denial of Service attack).

    \nThe Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a Denial of Service
    attack, that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression
    implementations may reach extreme situations that cause them to work
    very slowly (exponentially related to input size). An attacker can then
    cause a program using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme
    situations and then hang for a very long time. \[1\]
