  title: Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol
  description: |
    [`rocketmake-nuget`][1] Affected versions of the package are vulnerable
    to Man in the Middle (MitM) attacks due to downloading resources over an
    insecure protocol. Without a secure connection, it is possible for an
    attacker to intercept this connection and alter the packages received.
    In serious cases, this may even lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on
    your host server.

    You can read more about `Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol` on
    our [blog][2].

    Thanks to [Liang Gong][3] for disclosing this vulnerability!
