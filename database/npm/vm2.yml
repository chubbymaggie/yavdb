  title: Sandbox Bypass
  description: |
    [vm2][1] is a sandbox that can run untrusted code with whitelisted
    Node\'s built-in modules.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Sandbox Bypass. It
    is possible to trigger a `RangeError` exception from the host rather
    than the \"sandboxed\" context by reaching the stack call limit with an
    infinite recursion. The returned object is then used to reference the
    `mainModule` property of the host code running the script allowing it to
    spawn a `child_process` and execute arbitrary code.
