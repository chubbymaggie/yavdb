  title: Arbitrary File Overwrite
  description: |
    [tar-fs][1] is a filesystem bindings for tar-stream.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File
    Overwrite. An attacker can overwrite files on the system when extracting
    a `tarball` containing a hardlink to a file that already exists on the
    system, in conjunction with a later plain file with the same name as the
    hardlink. This plain file content replaces the existing file content.
