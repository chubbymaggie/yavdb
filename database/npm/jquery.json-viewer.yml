  title: Cross-Site Scripting
  description: "Versions of `jquery.json-viewer` prior to 1.3.0 are vulnerable to
    Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The package insufficiently sanitizes user input when
    creating links, and concatenates the user input in an `<a>` tag. This allows attackers
    to create malicious links with JSON payloads such as: \n```\n{\n  \"foo\": \"https://bar.com\\\"
    onmouseover=alert('xss') \\\"\"\n}\n```\n\nThis may lead to arbitrary JavaScript
    execution in a victim's browser."
