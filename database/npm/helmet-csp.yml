  title: Configuration Override
  description: Versions of `helmet-csp` before to 2.9.1 are vulnerable to a Configuration
    Override affecting the application's Content Security Policy (CSP). The package's
    browser sniffing for Firefox deletes the `default-src` CSP policy, which is the
    fallback policy. This allows an attacker to remove an application's default CSP,
    possibly rendering the application vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting.
