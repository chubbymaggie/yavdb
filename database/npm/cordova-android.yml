  title: Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol

    [cordova-android][1] is an Android application library that allows for
    Cordova-based projects to be built for the Android Platform.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Man in the Middle
    (MitM) attacks due to downloading resources over an insecure protocol.

    The build scripts would fetch Gradle using HTTP instead of HTTPS

    Without a secure connection, it is possible for an attacker to intercept
    this connection and alter the packages received. In serious cases, this
    may even lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on your host server.
