  title: Outdated Static Dependency
  description: Versions of `ses` prior to 0.6.3 contain an Outdated Static Dependency.
    The package relies on `realms-shim` and has it loaded statically instead of as
    a dependency that can be updated. The version of `realms-shim` it has contains
    multiple critical Sandbox Breakout vulnerabilities.
