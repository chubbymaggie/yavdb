    over an unencrypted HTTP connection. \r\n\r\nIn scenarios where an attacker has
    a privileged network position, it is possible to intercept the responses and replace
    the dependencies with malicious ones, resulting in code execution on the system
    running `hubl-server`."

  title: Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol
  description: |
    [`hubl-server`][1] is a Wrapper for the HubL Development Server.
    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Man in the Middle
    (MitM) attacks due to downloading resources over an insecure protocol.
    Without a secure connection, it is possible for an attacker to intercept
    this connection and alter the packages received. In serious cases, this
    may even lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on your host server.

    You can read more about `Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol` on
