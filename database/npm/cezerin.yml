  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [cezerin][1] is a React and Node.js based eCommerce platform.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access
    Control. Certain internal attributes (e.g., paid and tax) within
    `getValidDocumentForUpdate` in
    `src/api/server/services/orders/orders.js` function can be overwritten
    via a conflicting name from user-input. As such, it is possible for a
    malicious customer to manipulate certain order status (i.e., payment
    status, tax) by adding additional attributes to user-input during
    checkout.
