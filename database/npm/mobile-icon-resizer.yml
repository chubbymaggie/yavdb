  description: |-
    mobile-icon-resizer resizes large images for use as icons for iOS and Android.

    mobile-icon-resizer has a code execution vulnerability in versions before 0.4.3.

    mobile-icon-resizer takes an options object as an argument to define the resulting icons as such:
    ```
    var options = {
      config: './config.js'
    }
    resize(options, function(err){});
    ```
    config.js would need to be a file on the filesystem and look something like:
    ```
    var config = {
      iOS: {
        "images": [
         /* iOS image definitions are not vulnerable */
        ]
      },
      android: {
        "images" : [
          {
            "baseRatio" : "console.log('Executing script as baseRatio property')",
            "folder" : "drawable-ldpi"
          },
          {
            "ratio" : "console.log('Executing script as ratio property')",
            "folder" : "drawable-mdpi"
          },
        /* other android image defintiions ... */
        ]
      }
    };

    exports = module.exports = config;
    ```
    The parameters `ratio` and `baseRatio` are passed directly to `eval()`, thus allowing dynamic javascript payloads to be executed.

    [`mobile-icon-resizer`][1] is a tool used to resize iOS and Android
    application icons in batch.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Injection due to unsafe use of the `eval()` function. Node.js provides
    the `eval()` function by default, and is used to translate strings into
    Javascript code. An attacker can craft a malicious payload to inject
    arbitrary commands.
