  title: Broken CORS
  description: "> Version 0.12.6 and lower have an issue with the CORS configuration
    where the value of the origin header is reflected as the value for the Access-Control-Allow-Origin
    header. This would allow an attacker to make AJAX requests to vulnerable hosts
    through cross site scripting or a malicious HTML Document, effectively bypassing
    the Same Origin Policy.\n> \n> -- [nodesecurity.io](https://nodesecurity.io/advisories/148)"
