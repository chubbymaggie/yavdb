  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: Versions of `require-node` prior to 1.3.4 for 1.x and 2.0.4 for 2.x
    are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Execution. The package fails to sanitize requests
    to the `require-node` endpoint, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code in
    the server through the injection of OS commands in the request body.

  - ">2.0.0 <2.0.4"
