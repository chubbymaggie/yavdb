  title: Authorization Bypass
  description: Versions of `graphql-shield` prior to 6.0.6 are vulnerable to an Authorization
    Bypass. The rule caching option `no_cache` relies on keys generated by cryptographically
    insecure functions, which may cause rules to be incorrectly cached. This allows
    attackers to access information they should not have access to in case of a key
    collision.
