  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |+
    The `jsjws` is a pure JavaScript implementation of JSON Web Signature.
    JSON Web Tokens are an open, industry standard method for representing
    claims securely between two parties.

    Affected versions of this module treated tokens signed with the `none`
    algorithm as a valid token with a verified signature and resulted in
    giving attackers arbitrary account access.
