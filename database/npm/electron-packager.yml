  title: SSL Validation disabled by default
  description: |+
    `electron-packager` is a command line tool that lets you package and
    distribute your Electron app with OS-specific bundles (.app, .exe etc)
    via JS or CLI.

    Versions `5.2.1-6.0.2` have the `--strict-ssl` command line option
    default to false (causing strict-ssl to not be enabled). This could
    allow an attacker to execute a SSL Man In The Middle attack and deliver
    a malicious electron version that also gets cached in `~/.electron`
    folder.
