  description: |
    `event-stream` is a toolkit to make creating and working with streams
    easy.

    Version 3.3.6 was hijacked via a child dependency, flatmap-stream, which
    was overtaken by a malicious actor. The attacker has injected the
    malicious package which was used in order to steal bitcoins from
    wallets.
