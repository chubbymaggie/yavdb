  title: Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
  description: "The package is vulnerable to cross site scripting due to insufficient
    input escaping.\n\n> Handlebars template[s] that [use] user input in an HTML attribute
    value [are] wide open to a trivial XSS exploit. Note that unquoted attribute values
    are still open to attack, but this set of characters at least brings Handlebars
    in line with other Mustache implementations and other template languages.\n> \n>
