  title: Prototype Pollution
  description: All versions of `upmerge` are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution. The
    merge() function fails to prevent user input to alter an Object's prototype, allowing
    attackers to modify override properties of all objects in the application. This
    may lead to Denial of Service or may be chained with other vulnerabilities leading
    to Remote Code Execution.
