  title: Denial of Service
  description: All versions of `subtext` are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS).
    The package fails to enforce the `maxBytes` configuration for payloads with chunked
    encoding that are written to the file system. This allows attackers to send requests
    with arbitrary payload sizes, which may exhaust system resources leading to Denial
    of Service.
