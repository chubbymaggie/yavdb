  title: Open Redirect
  description: |-
    Versions of `serve-static` prior to 1.6.5 ( or 1.7.x prior to 1.7.2 ) are affected by an open redirect vulnerability on some browsers when configured to mount at the root directory.


    ## Proof of Concept

    A link to `http://example.com//www.google.com/%2e%2e` will redirect to `//www.google.com/%2e%2e`

    Some browsers will interpret this as `http://www.google.com/%2e%2e`, resulting in an external redirect.
