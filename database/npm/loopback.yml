  title: Improper Authorization
  description: Vulnerable versions of `loopback` may allow attackers to create Authentication
    Tokens on behalf of other users due to Improper Authorization. If the AccessToken
    model is publicly exposed, an attacker can create Authorization Tokens for any
    user as long as they know the target's `userId`. This will allow the attacker
    to access the user's data and their privileges.

  title: Improper Authorization
  description: |
    [loopback][1] is a highly-extensible, open-source Node.js framework that
    enables you to create dynamic end-to-end REST APIs, access data from
    several databases, incorporate model relationships and access controls
    for complex APIs, and more.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authorization. An attacker can create Authentication Tokens on behalf of
    other users. If the AccessToken model is publicly exposed, the attacker
    can create tokens for any user as long as they know the target\'s
    userId. This will allow the attacker to access the user\'s data and
    their privileges.
