  title: Improper Authorization
  description: Vulnerable versions of `loopback` may allow attackers to create Authentication
    Tokens on behalf of other users due to Improper Authorization. If the AccessToken
    model is publicly exposed, an attacker can create Authorization Tokens for any
    user as long as they know the target's `userId`. This will allow the attacker
    to access the user's data and their privileges.
