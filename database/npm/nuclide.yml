  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [nuclide][1] is a collection of features for Atom to provide IDE-like
    functionality for a variety of programming languages and technologies.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. The `hhvm-attach` deep link handler in Nuclide did not
    properly sanitize the provided hostname parameter when rendering. As a
    result, a malicious URL could be used to render HTML and other content
    inside of the editor\'s context, which could potentially be chained to
    lead to code execution.
