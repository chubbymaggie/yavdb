  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service
  description: Versions of `csv-parse` prior to 4.4.6 are vulnerable to Regular Expression
    Denial of Service. The `__isInt()` function contains a malformed regular expression
    that processes large specially-crafted input very slowly, leading to a Denial
    of Service. This is triggered when using the `cast` option.
