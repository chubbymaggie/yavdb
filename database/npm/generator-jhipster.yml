  title: fixed timing attack vulnerability in TokenProvider
  description: "> The TokenProvider uses String.equals(str) to compare the given token-signature
    with a calculated one. This method uses a break-on-inequality algorithm. This
    makes the TokenProvider vulnerable to timing attacks, where an attacker can forge
    a token with any username more easily than using brute force.\n> \n> -- [github.com](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/2095)"

  title: Mishandled Logout Function
  description: |
    [`generator-jhipster`][1] is a Spring Boot + Angular in one handy
    generator. Affected versions of the package are vulnerable due to the
    mishandling if the logout function in IE8. When an admin logs out, the
    session is not properly cleared and any user logging in afterward will
    have admin permissions. A malicious user could use this to their
    advantage.

    **Note:** This only occurs on IE8.
