  title: Cross-Site Scripting
  description: |
    Affected versions of `swagger-ui` are vulnerable to cross-site scripting in both the `consumes` and `produces` parameters of the swagger JSON document for a given API.

    Additionally, `swagger-ui` allows users to load arbitrary swagger JSON documents via the query string parameter `url`, allowing an attacker to exploit this attack against any user that the attacker can convince to visit a crafted link.

    ## Proof of Concept

    Affected versions of `swagger-ui` contain a cross-site scripting vulnerability in the key names of a specific nested object in the JSON document.


    ## Proof of Concept
    The vulnerable object structure is:
    ```
    {
        "definitions": {
            "arbitraryVal": {
                "properties": {

                }
            }
    }
    ```
    Malicious JSON documents can be loaded in by providing a URL to them in the `url` query string parameter.

  title: Cross-Site Scripting
  description: |-
    Affected versions of `swagger-ui` are vulnerable to cross-site scripting. This vulnerability exists because `swagger-ui` automatically executes external Javascript that is loaded in via the `url` query string parameter when a `Content-Type: application/javascript` header is included.

    An attacker can create a server that replies with a malicious script and the proper content-type, and then craft a `swagger-ui` URL that includes the location to their server/script in the `url` query string parameter. When viewed, such a link would execute the attacker's malicious script.

  title: XSS in Consumes/Produces Parameter
  description: |+
    Swagger UI is a dependency-free collection of HTML, Javascript, and CSS
    assets that dynamically generate documentation from a Swagger-compliant
    API.

    A key part of this generation is the use of a JSON schema, which can be
    read locally or by providing a `url` parameter to the Swagger server
    (e.g. `http://swagger-server/swagger-ui/index.html?url=<schema-url>`).

    The `produces` and `consumes` schema fields are written to the HTML
    without any HTML encoding, allowing an attacker to perform XSS by adding
    malicious scripts to their values.

    \nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker tricks a
    user’s browser to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a
    victim’s domain. Such scripts can steal the user’s session cookies for
    the domain, scrape or modify its content, and perform or modify actions
    on the user’s behalf, actions typically blocked by the browser’s Same
    Origin Policy.

    These attacks are possible by escaping the context of the web
    application and injecting malicious scripts in an otherwise trusted
    website. These scripts can introduce additional attributes (say, a
    \"new\" option in a dropdown list or a new link to a malicious site) and
    can potentially execute code on the clients side, unbeknown to the
    victim. This occurs when characters like `<` `>` `"` `'` are not escaped
    properly.

    There are a few types of XSS:

    * **Persistent XSS** is an attack in which the malicious code persists
      into the web app’s database.
    * **Reflected XSS** is an which the website echoes back a portion of the
      request. The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking a
      malicious link (for instance through a phishing email or malicious JS
      on another page), which triggers the XSS attack.
    * **DOM-based XSS** is an that occurs purely in the browser when
      client-side JavaScript echoes back a portion of the URL onto the page.
      DOM-Based XSS is notoriously hard to detect, as the server never gets
      a chance to see the attack taking place.

  description: |+
    `swagger-ui` supports receiving headers (e.g. Content-Type) from the
    Swagger-conforming API server, to be used when demonstrating use of the
    API using `curl`. Those headers are injected into the documentation
    as-is (not encoded), allowing a malicious API server to inject a script
    (XSS) into the swagger-ui front-end.

    \nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker tricks a
    user’s browser to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a
    victim’s domain. Such scripts can steal the user’s session cookies for
    the domain, scrape or modify its content, and perform or modify actions
    on the user’s behalf, actions typically blocked by the browser’s Same
    Origin Policy.

    These attacks are possible by escaping the context of the web
    application and injecting malicious scripts in an otherwise trusted
    website. These scripts can introduce additional attributes (say, a
    \"new\" option in a dropdown list or a new link to a malicious site) and
    can potentially execute code on the clients side, unbeknown to the
    victim. This occurs when characters like `<` `>` `"` `'` are not escaped
    properly.

    There are a few types of XSS:

    * **Persistent XSS** is an attack in which the malicious code persists
      into the web app’s database.
    * **Reflected XSS** is an which the website echoes back a portion of the
      request. The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking a
      malicious link (for instance through a phishing email or malicious JS
      on another page), which triggers the XSS attack.
    * **DOM-based XSS** is an that occurs purely in the browser when
      client-side JavaScript echoes back a portion of the URL onto the page.
      DOM-Based XSS is notoriously hard to detect, as the server never gets
      a chance to see the attack taking place.
