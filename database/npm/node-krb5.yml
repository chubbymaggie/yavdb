  title: Spoofing attack due to unvalidated KDC
  description: Affected versions of `node-krb5` do not validate the KDC prior to authenticating,
    which might allow an attacker with network access and enough time to spoof the
    KDC and impersonate a valid user without knowing their credentials.
  affected_package: node-krb5
  vulnerable_versions:
  - "<=99.999.99999"
  patched_versions:
  - "<0.0.0"
  severity: medium

  cve:
  - CVE-2016-1000238

    [\'node-krb5\'][1] is a node.js native add-on for simple krb5 user
    authentication.

    Current implementation does not verify the Kerberos Key Distribution
    Center (KDC): it accepts a username/password from the user, then asks a
    KDC whether that password is correct for the corresponding Kerberos
    principal - without assurance that the response came from a real KDC.
