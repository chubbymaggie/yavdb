  title: Spoofing attack due to unvalidated KDC
  description: |
    [\'node-krb5\'][1] is a node.js native add-on for simple krb5 user
    authentication.

    Current implementation does not verify the Kerberos Key Distribution
    Center (KDC): it accepts a username/password from the user, then asks a
    KDC whether that password is correct for the corresponding Kerberos
    principal - without assurance that the response came from a real KDC.
