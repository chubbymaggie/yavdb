  title: Symlink File Overwrite
  description: |
    The [`tar`][1] module prior to version 2.0.0 does not properly normalize
    symbolic links pointing to targets outside the extraction root. As a
    result, packages may hold symbolic links to parent and sibling
    directories and overwrite those files when the package is extracted.
