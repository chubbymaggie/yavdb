  title: Arbitrary Code Injection
  description: |
    [dot][1] is a fastest and concise JavaScript templating function with
    emphasis on performance under V8 and nodejs. It shows great performance
    for both nodejs and browsers.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Injection. An attacker can inject code to the template, or if a
    Prototype Pollution-like vulnerability can be exploited to alter an
    Object\'s prototype, the template compilation may execute arbitrary
    commands.
