  title: Resources Downloaded over Insecure Protocol
  description: |
    [`broccoli-closure`][1] broccoli-closure is a Closure compiler plugin
    for Broccoli.

    broccoli-closure downloads binary resources over HTTP, which leaves it
    vulnerable to MITM attacks. It may be possible to cause remote code
    execution (RCE) by swapping out the requested binary with an attacker
    controlled binary if the attacker is on the network or positioned in
    between the user and the remote server.
