  title: Forgeable public/private tokens
  description: |
    [\'jwt-simple\'][1] is a `JSON Web Token` encode and decode module.
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to an Authentication
    Bypass attack, due to the \"algorithm\" not being enforced. Attackers
    are given the opportunity to choose the algorithm sent to the server and
    generate signatures with arbitrary contents. The server expects an
    asymmetric key (RSA) but is sent a symmetric key (HMAC-SHA) with RSA\'s
    public key, so instead of going through a key validation process, the
    server will think the public key is actually an HMAC private key.
