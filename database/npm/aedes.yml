  title: Improper Authorization
  description: |
    [aedes][1] is a Barebone MQTT server that can run on any stream server.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authorization. A user can connect and subscribe to \"will\" from a
    client. From another client, a user may connect with a last will message
    with topic \"will\". Then by sending message to \"test\", the connection
    will break (because of authorization failure). Breaking the connection
    will trigger the LWT, and thus sends a message to `will`, which can be
    seen in the other client.
