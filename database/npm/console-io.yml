  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: 'Affected versions of the `console-io` package do not configure the
    underlying websocket library to require authentication, resulting in an authentication
    bypass vulnerability. As `console-io` allows terminal access on the server via
    a web page, an authentication bypass is essentially remote code execution.

    The `console-io` package allows users to have a web console in their
    application.

    Versions prior to 2.3.0 did not require authentication for socket.io,
    thus allowing attackers to send and execute shell commands over a
    websocket.
