  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [safe-compare][1] is a Constant-time comparison algorithm to prevent
    Node.js timing attacks.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Timing Attack via
    the `nativeTimingSafeEqual` function which could leak the length of a
    user password. This is caused by always choosing the length of the
    longer string when comparing.

    [`safe-compare`][1] is Constant-time comparison algorithm to prevent
    timing attacks..

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Insecure Credential
    Comparison due to using `String.prototype.length` instead of
    `Buffer.byteLength`.

  title: Insecure Credential Comparison
  description: |
    [`safe-compare`][1] is a constant-time comparison algorithm to prevent
    timing attacks..

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Insecure Credential
    Comparison. It used the `bufferAlloc` constructor incorrectly, which
    caused the password string to be \"padded\" with itself. This means that
    the passwords `"a"` and `"aaaaaaaaaaaaa"` would be equal.
