    [`safe-compare`][1] is a constant-time comparison algorithm to prevent
    timing attacks..

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Insecure Credential
    Comparison. It used the `bufferAlloc` constructor incorrectly, which
    caused the password string to be \"padded\" with itself. This means that
    the passwords `"a"` and `"aaaaaaaaaaaaa"` would be equal.
