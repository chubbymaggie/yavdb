  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [cryptpad][1] is a Zero Knowledge realtime collaborative editor.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access
    Control. Users with edit access rights for rich text pads could change
    the URL of a document to load the same document in a code pad. As such,
    it is possible to invalidate the existing stored content, making it
    impossible to load the same document in the rich text editor. This
    vulnerability could lead to data loss via a trivial URL modification.
