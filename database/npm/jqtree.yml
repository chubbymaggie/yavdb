    [`jqTree`][1] is a jQuery plugin for displaying and manipulating
    hierarchical data in a tree format.

    Versions 1.3.3 and below contain a cross site scripting vulnerability in
    the drag and drop functionality for modifying tree data. A node that
    contains a standard XSS vector will have its payload execute when a user
    attempts to drag a node to a different position in the hierarchy.
