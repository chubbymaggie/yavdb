  title: Denial of Service
  description: Versions of `grpc-ts-health-check` prior to 2.0.0 are vulnerable to
    Denial of Service. The package exposes an API endpoint that may allow attackers
    to set the service's health status to failing. This can lead to Denial of Service
    as Kubernetes blocks traffic to services with a failing status.
  affected_package: grpc-ts-health-check
  vulnerable_versions:
  - "<2.0.0"
  severity: low
  package_manager: npm
