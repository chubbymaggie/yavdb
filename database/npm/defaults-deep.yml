  title: Prototype Pollution
  description: |
    [defaults-deep][1] is a package that deeply assigns the enumerable
    properties and/or es6 Symbol properies of source objects to the target
    (first) object.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution
    via merging functions. These functions allows a malicious user to modify
    the prototype of `Object` via `__proto__`, causing the addition or
    modification of an existing property that will exist on all objects.
