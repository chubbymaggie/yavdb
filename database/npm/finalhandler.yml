  title: Insecure Default Configuration
  description: All versions of `finalhandler` have an Insecure Default Configuration.
    The package sets the Content-Security-Policy to `self`, which allows directives
    such as `frame-src`, `img-src` and `script-src` to be loaded. This may be chained
    with other vulnerabilities and result in Cross-Site Scripting.
