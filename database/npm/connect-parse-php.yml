  title: Arbitrary File Write
  description: |
    [`connect-parse-php`][1] is a php parsing middleware for
    grunt-contrib-connect.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Directory Traversal,
    which may allow access to sensitive files and data on the server. For
    example, requesting the following url `/..%2f..%2fetc/passwd` would
    result in `/etc/passwd` leak.

    Thanks to [Liang Gong][2] for disclosing this vulnerability!
