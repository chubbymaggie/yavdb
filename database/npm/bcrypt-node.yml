  title: Hash collision
  description: |-
    There was an issue with hashing string formed of multi-byte characters.
    Only one of the byte of the character was taken into account when
    building the hash.
    ...
    Unfortunately, this makes any non-latin passwords previously hashed by
    the code obsolete and totally impossible to verify. Any password containing
    UTF-8 multi-byte characters hashed with the previous version of the code
    cannot be verified after this change is applied.
