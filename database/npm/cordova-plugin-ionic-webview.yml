  title: Path Traversal
  description: Versions of `cordova-plugin-ionic-webview` prior to 2.2.0 are vulnerable
    to Path Traversal, allowing attackers access to OS local files that should be
    inaccessible by third-party applications.  The package launches a webserver listening
    on http://localhost:8080 without restricting access of the app itself, thus escaping
    the iOS application sandbox and accessing local files.
  affected_package: cordova-plugin-ionic-webview
  vulnerable_versions:
  - "<2.2.0"
  severity: high
  package_manager: npm
  cve:
  - CVE-2018-16202
