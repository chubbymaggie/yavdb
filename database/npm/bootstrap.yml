  title: Default tooltip option allows users to have XSS vulnerability in some situations
  description: |
    There is an html option for popover/tooltip again. The option is defaulted to true.

    Having this option allows us to force the popover to use the .text() method to set the title and content of the popover no matter if bootstrap thinks it detects html or not. The problem is that jQuery seems to unescape values grabbed with the .attr() method, so even if you escape <script>alert('data');</script> to <script>alert("data")</script> and set it as your data-content, bootstrap will get the unescaped value from .attr(), detect that this is html and use the .html() method to set the content of the popover causing an XSS issue. Forcing the use of the .text() method by setting the html option to false lets us make sure that doesn't happen.

  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: |+
    [`bootstrap`][1] is a popular front-end framework for developing
    responsive, mobile first projects on the web.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS). The html option for popovers/tooltips is unescaped when grabbed
    with jQuery\'s `.attr()` method. This may allow attackers to execute XSS
    attacks.



    [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap
    \nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker tricks a
    user’s browser to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a
    victim’s domain. Such scripts can steal the user’s session cookies for
    the domain, scrape or modify its content, and perform or modify actions
    on the user’s behalf, actions typically blocked by the browser’s Same
    Origin Policy.

    These attacks are possible by escaping the context of the web
    application and injecting malicious scripts in an otherwise trusted
    website. These scripts can introduce additional attributes (say, a
    \"new\" option in a dropdown list or a new link to a malicious site) and
    can potentially execute code on the clients side, unbeknown to the
    victim. This occurs when characters like `<` `>` `"` `'` are not escaped
    properly.

    There are a few types of XSS:

    * **Persistent XSS** is an attack in which the malicious code persists
      into the web app’s database.
    * **Reflected XSS** is an which the website echoes back a portion of the
      request. The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking a
      malicious link (for instance through a phishing email or malicious JS
      on another page), which triggers the XSS attack.
    * **DOM-based XSS** is an that occurs purely in the browser when
      client-side JavaScript echoes back a portion of the URL onto the page.
      DOM-Based XSS is notoriously hard to detect, as the server never gets
      a chance to see the attack taking place.
