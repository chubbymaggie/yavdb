  title: XSS in autoescape mode
  description: "> Versions 2.4.2 and lower have a cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability
    in autoescape mode. In autoescape mode, all template vars should automatically
    be escaped. By using an array for the keys, such as name[]=<script>alert(1)</script>,
    it is possible to bypass autoescaping and inject content into the DOM.\n> \n>
