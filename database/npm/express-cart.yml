  title: NoSQL injection
  description: "Versions of `express-cart` before 1.1.8 are vulnerable to NoSQL injection.
    \n\nThe vulnerability is caused by the lack of user input sanitization in the
    login handlers. In both cases, the customer login and the admin login, parameters
    from the JSON body are sent directly into the MongoDB query which allows to insert
    operators. \n\nThese operators can be used to extract the value of the field blindly
    in the same manner of a blind SQL injection. In this case, the `$regex` operator
    is used to guess each character of the token from the start."

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [express-cart][1] is a fully functional shopping cart built in Node.js
    (Express, MongoDB) with Stripe, PayPal and Authorize.net payments.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. It allows a privileged users to upload files to the server,
    and choose which path it\'ll be saved in. The path does not do through
    validation, nor is the file type or size validated. This may allow an
    attacker to upload malicious files that may execute code on the server,
    send data back to the attacker or cause a denial of service.
