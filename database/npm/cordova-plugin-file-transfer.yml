    ios/CDVFileTransfer.m in the Apache Cordova File-Transfer standalone
    plugin (org.apache.cordova.file-transfer) before 0.4.2 for iOS and the

    \nWhen deciding on the default configuration, the package owner must take
    into consideration both usability and security, based on reasonable
    assumptions to how their package will be used. But more often then not,
    package consumers do not abide by said assumptions and this may open
    their hosting server to attacks by malicious users.

    You can read more about `Insecure Defaults` on our [blog][1].
