  title: Arbitrary Code Injection
  description: |
    [`mongoosify`][1] is a prototype-based inheritance library that makes it
    easy to create objects and inheritance hierarchies without losing the
    power of javascript\'s prototype system.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Injection due to unsafe use of the `eval()` function. Node.js provides
    the `eval()` function by default, and is used to translate strings into
    Javascript code. An attacker can craft a malicious payload to inject
    arbitrary commands.
