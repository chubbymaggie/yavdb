  title: Cross-Site Scripting
  description: |-
    Versions of `handlebars` prior to 4.0.0 are affected by a cross-site scripting vulnerability when attributes in handlebar templates are not quoted.


    ## Proof of Concept
    Template:
    ```<a href={{foo}}/>```

    Input:
    ```{ 'foo' : 'test.com onload=alert(1)'}```

    Rendered result:
    ```<a href=test.com onload=alert(1)/>```

  description: "[handlebars][1] is a extension to the Mustache templating language.\n\nAffected
    versions of this package are vulnerable to Prototype Pollution.\nA Prototype Pollution
    allowing Remote Code Execution can be exploited\nusing the constructor, via the
    \\'lookup\\' helper. This vulnerability is\ndue to an incomplete fix for: `SNYK-JS-HANDLEBARS-173692`\n\n\n\n[1]:
    https://www.npmjs.com/package/handlebars\n\\nPrototype Pollution is a vulnerability
    affecting JavaScript. Prototype\nPollution refers to the ability to inject properties
    into existing\nJavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript\nallows
    all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical\nattributes such
    as `_proto_`, `constructor` and `prototype`. An attacker\nmanipulates these attributes
    to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript\napplication object prototype of the base
    object by injecting other\nvalues. Properties on the `Object.prototype` are then
    inherited by all\nthe JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that
    happens,\nthis leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript\nexceptions,
    or it tampers with the application source code to force the\ncode path that the
    attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code\nexecution.\n\nThere are two
    main ways in which the pollution of prototypes occurs:\n\n* Unsafe `Object` recursive
    merge\n\n* Property definition by path\n\n### Unsafe Object recursive merge   {#unsafe-object-recursive-merge}\n\nThe
    logic of a vulnerable recursive merge function follows the following\nhigh-level
    model:\n\n    merge (target, source)\n    \n    foreach property of source\n    \n
    \   if property exists and is an object on both the target and the source\n    \n
    \   merge(target[property], source[property])\n    \n    else\n    \n    target[property]
    = source[property]\n\n\n\nWhen the source object contains a property named `_proto_`
    defined with\n`Object.defineProperty()` , the condition that checks if the property\nexists
    and is an object on both the target and the source passes and the\nmerge recurses
    with the target, being the prototype of `Object` and the\nsource of `Object` as
    defined by the attacker. Properties are then\ncopied on the `Object` prototype.\n\nClone
    operations are a special sub-class of unsafe recursive merges,\nwhich occur when
    a recursive merge is conducted on an empty object:\n`merge({},source)`.\n\n`lodash`
    and `Hoek` are examples of libraries susceptible to recursive\nmerge attacks.\n\n###
    Property definition by path   {#property-definition-by-path}\n\nThere are a few
    JavaScript libraries that use an API to define property\nvalues on an object based
    on a given path. The function that is\ngenerally affected contains this signature:
    `theFunction(object, path,\nvalue)`\n\nIf the attacker can control the value of
    “path”, they can set this value\nto `_proto_.myValue`. `myValue` is then assigned
    to the prototype of the\nclass of the object.\n\n"

  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: |+
    [handlebars][1] provides the power necessary to let you build semantic
    templates.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS) attacks. Only the `<` and `>` chars were escaped. This meant that
    any Handlebars template that user used input in an HTML attribute value
    was wide open to a trivial XSS exploit. Note that unquoted attribute
    values are still open to attack, but this set of characters at least
    brings Handlebars in line with other Mustache implementations and other
    template languages.



    [1]: https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/
    \nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker tricks a
    user’s browser to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a
    victim’s domain. Such scripts can steal the user’s session cookies for
    the domain, scrape or modify its content, and perform or modify actions
    on the user’s behalf, actions typically blocked by the browser’s Same
    Origin Policy.

    These attacks are possible by escaping the context of the web
    application and injecting malicious scripts in an otherwise trusted
    website. These scripts can introduce additional attributes (say, a
    \"new\" option in a dropdown list or a new link to a malicious site) and
    can potentially execute code on the clients side, unbeknown to the
    victim. This occurs when characters like `<` `>` `"` `'` are not escaped
    properly.

    There are a few types of XSS:

    * **Persistent XSS** is an attack in which the malicious code persists
      into the web app’s database.
    * **Reflected XSS** is an which the website echoes back a portion of the
      request. The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking a
      malicious link (for instance through a phishing email or malicious JS
      on another page), which triggers the XSS attack.
    * **DOM-based XSS** is an that occurs purely in the browser when
      client-side JavaScript echoes back a portion of the URL onto the page.
      DOM-Based XSS is notoriously hard to detect, as the server never gets
      a chance to see the attack taking place.

    [handlebars][1] provides the power necessary to let you build semantic
    templates.

    When using attributes without quotes in a handlebars template, an
    attacker can manipulate the input to introduce additional attributes,
    potentially executing code. This may lead to a Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS) vulnerability, assuming an attacker can influence the value
    entered into the template. If the handlebars template is used to render
    user-generated content, this vulnerability may escalate to a persistent
    XSS vulnerability.

    **Example:**

    Assume handlebars was used to display user comments and avatar, using
    the following template: `<img src={{avatarUrl}}><pre>{{comment}}</pre>`

    If an attacker spoofed their avatar URL and provided the following
    value: `http://evil.org/avatar.png onload=alert(document.cookie)`

    The resulting HTML would be the following, triggering the script once
    the image loads: `<img src=http://evil.org/avatar.png
    onload=alert(document.cookie)><pre>Gotcha!</pre>`
