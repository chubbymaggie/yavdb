  title: Downloads Resources over HTTP
  description: "Affected versions of `appium-chromedriver` insecurely download resources
    over HTTP. \r\n\r\nIn scenarios where an attacker has a privileged network position,
    they can modify or read items send over HTTP at will. In this case, that includes
    the chromedriver binary, which may result in remote code execution if overwritten
    with a malicious binary."
