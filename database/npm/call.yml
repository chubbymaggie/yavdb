  title: Improper input validation
  description: |
    [`call`][1] is the primary HTTP router of the [`hapi`][2] framework.

    The vulnerability arise from `undefined` values inside a path (last
    segment being an exception) making their way into components that do not
    care for values being `undefined` (eg. the database layer).

    For example, the request URI `/delete/company//` may incorrectly match a
    route looking for `/delete/company/{company}/`. By itself, the bad match
    is not a vulnerability. However, depending on the remaining logic in the
    application, such a bad match may result in skipping a protection
    mechanisms. In the above example, if the route translates to a DB delete
    command, it might delete all the companies from the db.
