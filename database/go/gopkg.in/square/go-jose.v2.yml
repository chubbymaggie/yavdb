  title: Elliptic Curve Key Disclosure
  description: |
    Affected version of [`github.com/square/go-jose`][1] are vulnerable to
    Elliptic Curve Key Disclosure. go-jose before 1.0.4 suffers from an
    invalid curve attack for the ECDH-ES algorithm. When deriving a shared
    key using ECDH-ES for an encrypted message, go-jose neglected to check
    that the received public key on a message is on the same curve as the
    static private key of the receiver, thus making it vulnerable to an
    invalid curve attack.
