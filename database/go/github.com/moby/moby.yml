  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |+
    [github.com/moby/moby](github.com/moby/moby) is a collaborative project
    for the container ecosystem to assemble container-based systems.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. The Docker engine validated a client TLS certificate using both
    the configured client CA root certificate and all system roots on
    non-Windows systems. This allowed a client with any domain validated
    certificate signed by a system-trusted root CA to authenticate.
