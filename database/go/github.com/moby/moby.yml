  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |+
    [github.com/moby/moby](github.com/moby/moby) is a collaborative project
    for the container ecosystem to assemble container-based systems.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. The Docker engine validated a client TLS certificate using both
    the configured client CA root certificate and all system roots on
    non-Windows systems. This allowed a client with any domain validated
    certificate signed by a system-trusted root CA to authenticate.

  affected_package: github.com/moby/moby
  vulnerable_versions:
  - "<17.3.2-ce"
  severity: medium
  package_manager: go
  cwe:
  - CWE-288
  disclosed_date: 2017-05-12
  created_date: 2018-09-13
