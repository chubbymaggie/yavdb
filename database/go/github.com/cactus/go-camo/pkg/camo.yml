  title: Improper Input Validation
  description: |
    [github.com/cactus/go-camo/pkg/camo][1] is a HTTP proxy server with
    content type restrictions as well as regex host allow list support.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Input
    Validation. Insufficient content type validation of proxied resources in
    go-camo can allow a remote attacker to serve arbitrary content from
    go-camo\'s origin.
