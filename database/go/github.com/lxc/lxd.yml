  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    Affected version of [`github.com/lxc/lxd`][1] are vulnerable to
    Information Exposure. LXD before 2.0.2 does not properly set permissions
    when switching an unprivileged container into privileged mode, which
    allows local users to access arbitrary world readable paths in the
    container directory via unspecified vectors.

    Affected version of [`github.com/lxc/lxd`][1] are vulnerable to
    Information Exposure. LXD before 2.0.2 uses world-readable permissions
    for /var/lib/lxd/zfs.img when setting up a loop based ZFS pool, which
    allows local users to copy and read data from arbitrary containers via
    unspecified vectors.
