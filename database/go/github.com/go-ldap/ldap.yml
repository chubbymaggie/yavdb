  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |+
    [`github.com/go-ldap/ldap`](github.com/go-ldap/ldap) is a basic LDAP v3
    functionality for the GO programming language.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass.

    In the ldap.v2 (aka go-ldap) package through 2.5.0 for Go, an attacker
    may be able to login with an empty password. This issue affects an
    application using this package if these conditions are met: (1) it
    relies only on the return error of the Bind function call to determine
    whether a user is authorized (i.e., a nil return value is interpreted as
    successful authorization) and (2) it is used with an LDAP server
    allowing unauthenticated bind.
