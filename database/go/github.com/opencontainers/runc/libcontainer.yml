  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    Affected version of [`github.com/opencontainers/libcontainer`][1] are
    vulnerable to Information Exposure. RunC allowed additional container
    processes via \'runc exec\' to be ptraced by the pid 1 of the container.
    This allows the main processes of the container, if running as root, to
    gain access to file-descriptors of these new processes during the
    initialization and can lead to container escapes or modification of runC
    state before the process is fully placed inside the container.
