  title: Privilege Elevation
  description: |
    Affected version of
    [`github.com/opencontainers/runc/libcontainer/user`][1] are vulnerable
    to Privilege Elevation. libcontainer/user/user.go in runC before 0.1.0,
    as used in Docker before 1.11.2, improperly treats a numeric UID as a
    potential username, which allows local users to gain privileges via a
    numeric username in the password file in a container.
