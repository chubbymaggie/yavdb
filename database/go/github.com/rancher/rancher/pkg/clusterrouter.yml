  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [github.com/rancher/rancher/pkg/clusterrouter][1] is a project that
    provides a container management platform built for organizations that
    deploy containers in production

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). It allows an exploiter to gain access to clusters
    managed by Rancher. The attack requires a victim to be logged into a
    Rancher server, and then to access a third-party site hosted by the
    exploiter. The exploiter is then able to execute commands against the
    victims\' cluster\'s Kubernetes API with the permissions and identity of
    the victim.
