  title: DNS Rebinding
  description: |
    [github.com/coreos/etcd/pkg/httputil][1] is a distributed reliable
    key-value store for the most critical data of a distributed system.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to DNS Rebinding. An
    attacker can control their DNS records to direct to localhost, and trick
    the browser into sending requests to localhost (or any other address).

    [github.com/coreos/etcd/etcdmain][1] is a distributed reliable key-value
    store for the most critical data of a distributed system.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). An attacker can set up a website that tries to send a
    POST request to the etcd server and modify a key. Adding a key is done
    with PUT so it is theoretically safe (can\'t PUT from an HTML form or
    such) but POST allows creating in-order keys that an attacker can send.
