  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    Affected version of [`github.com/cloudflare/golz4`][1] are vulnerable to
    Arbitrary Code Execution.

    Vulnerable versions of the library used the obsolete native
    `LZ4_uncompress()` function possibly leading to memory corruption
    resulting in arbitrary code execution in case of successful
    exploitation. The fix made sure to use the safe version of the function
    called `LZ4_decompress_safe()`.
