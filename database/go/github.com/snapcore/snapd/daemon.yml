  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    Affected versions of [`github.com/snapcore/snapd/daemon`][1] are
    vulnerable to Authentication Bypass. The `snap logs` command could be
    made to call journalctl without match arguments and therefore allow
    unprivileged, unauthenticated users to bypass systemd-journald\'s access
    restrictions.
