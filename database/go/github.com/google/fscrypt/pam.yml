  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [`github.com/google/fscrypt/pam`][1] is a Go tool for managing Linux
    filesystem encryption.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Privilege Escalation.
    It incorrectly restored primary and supplementary group IDs to the
    values associated with the root user, which allowed attackers to gain
    privileges via a successful login through certain applications that use
    Linux-PAM (aka pam).
