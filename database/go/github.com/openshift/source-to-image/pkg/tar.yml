  title: Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip)
  description: "[`github.com/openshift/source-to-image/pkg/tar`][1] is a toolkit and\nworkflow
    for building reproducible Docker images from source code.\n\nAffected versions
    of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write\nvia Archive Extraction
    (AKA \\\"Zip Slip\\\").\n\nIt is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive,
    that holds path\ntraversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious
    archive\nis concatenated to the target extraction directory, which results in
    the\nfinal path ending up outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip\nmay
    hold a file with a \\\"../../file.exe\\\" location and thus break out of\nthe
    target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is\noverwritten with a
    file containing malicious code, the problem can turn\ninto an arbitrary code execution
    issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a zip archive with one benign
    file and\none malicious file. Extracting the malicous file will result in\ntraversing
    out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/`\noverwriting the `authorized_keys`
    file:\n\n    \n    +2018-04-15 22:04:29 ..... 19 19 good.txt\n    \n    +2018-04-15
