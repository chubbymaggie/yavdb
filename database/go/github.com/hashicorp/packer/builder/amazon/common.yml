  title: Insecure Defaults
  description: |
    [`github.com/hashicorp/packer/builder/amazon/common`][1] is a tool for
    creating identical machine images for multiple platforms from a single
    source configuration.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Insecure Defaults. It
    does not require the owners flag when describing images, which makes it
    easier for remote attackers to trigger the loading of an undesired AMI
    by setting similar image properties.

    You can read more about `Insecure Defaults` on our [blog][2].
