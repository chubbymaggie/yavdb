  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [github.com/sylabs/singularity/internal/pkg/runtime/engines/singularity][1]
    is an open source container platform designed to be simple, fast, and
    secure.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation. An attacker with local or network access to the host system
    (e.g. ssh) may be allowed to edit files within
    `/run/singularity/instances/sing/<user>/<instance>`. This is due to
    insecure permissions handling.
