  title: Cache Poisoning
  description: |
    [`grootfs`][1] is the Cloud Foundry component that provides filesystem
    isolation for containers and deals with container (Docker and OCI)
    images.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cache Poisoning.

    Cloud Foundry Foundation GrootFS release 0.3.x versions prior to 0.30.0
    do not validate DiffIDs, allowing specially crafted images to poison the
    grootfs volume cache. For example, this could allow an attacker to
    provide an image layer that GrootFS would consider to be the Ubuntu base
    layer.
