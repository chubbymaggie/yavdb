  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [`code.cloudfoundry.org/gorouter/proxy`][1] contains the source code for
    the Cloud Foundry L7 HTTP router.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass. It lacks sanitization for user-provided `X-Forwarded-Proto`
    headers. A remote user can set the `X-Forwarded-Proto` header in a
    request to potentially bypass an application requirement to only respond
    over secure connections.
