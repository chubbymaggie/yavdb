  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    Affected versions of [`github.com/golang/crypto/ssh`][1] are vulnerable
    to Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. The Go SSH library (x/crypto/ssh)
    by default does not verify host keys, facilitating man-in-the-middle
    attacks. Default behavior changed in commit [e4e2799][2] to require
    explicitly registering a hostkey verification mechanism.
