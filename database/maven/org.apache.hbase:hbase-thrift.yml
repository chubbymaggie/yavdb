  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [org.apache.hbase:hbase-thrift][1] is an open-source, distributed,
    versioned, column-oriented store modeled after Google\' Bigtable.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation. There is a race-condition which could lead to authenticated
    sessions being incorrectly applied to users, e.g. one authenticated user
    would be considered a different user or an unauthenticated user would be
    treated as an authenticated user.
