  title: "[CVE-2010-2076]  Improper Input Validation"
  description: Apache CXF 2.0.x before 2.0.13, 2.1.x before 2.1.10, and 2.2.x before
    2.2.9, as used in Apache ServiceMix, Apache Camel, Apache Chemistry, Apache jUDDI,
    Apache Geronimo, and other products, does not properly reject DTDs in SOAP messages,
    which allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files, send HTTP requests to intranet
    servers, or cause a denial of service (CPU and memory consumption) via a crafted
    DTD, as demonstrated by an entity declaration in a request to samples/wsdl_first_pure_xml,
    a similar issue to CVE-2010-1632.
