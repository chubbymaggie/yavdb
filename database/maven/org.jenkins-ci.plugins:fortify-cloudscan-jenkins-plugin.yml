  title: Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip)
  description: "[org.jenkins-ci.plugins:fortify-cloudscan-jenkins-plugin][1] allows
    an\norganization to host their own internal cloud-based infrastructure of\nStatic
    Code Analyzer (SCA) machines that are distributed jobs by a\ncentralized controller
    and optionally integrated with Software Security\nCenter (SSC).\n\nAffected versions
    of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write\nvia Archive Extraction
    (AKA \\\"Zip Slip\\\").\n\nIt is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive,
    that holds path\ntraversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious
    archive\nis concatenated to the target extraction directory, which results in
    the\nfinal path ending up outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip\nmay
    hold a file with a \\\"../../file.exe\\\" location and thus break out of\nthe
    target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is\noverwritten with a
    file containing malicious code, the problem can turn\ninto an arbitrary code execution
    issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a zip archive with one benign
    file and\none malicious file. Extracting the malicous file will result in\ntraversing
    out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/`\noverwriting the `authorized_keys`
    file:\n\n    \n    +2018-04-15 22:04:29 ..... 19 19 good.txt\n    \n    +2018-04-15
    22:04:42 ..... 20 20 ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\n\n\n[1]: https://github.com/jenkinsci/fortify-cloudscan-plugin\n"
