  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [com.blackducksoftware.integration:blackduck-detect][1] allows to run
    Detect in the Jenkins build.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure
    via the `DetectPostBuildStepDescriptor.java` method. An attacker with
    `Overall/Read` access could connect to an attacker-specified URL using
    attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method,
    capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
