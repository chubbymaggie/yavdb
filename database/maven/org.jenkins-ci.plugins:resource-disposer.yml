  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [Jenkins Resource Disposer Plugin][1] defines a single point of entry
    (`AsyncResourceDisposer.get().dispose(...)`) for plugins to get
    resources deleted asynchronously.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF) via the `AsyncResourceDisposer.java` class. It did not
    perform permission checks on an API endpoint, allowing users with
    `Overall/Read` access to Jenkins to stop tracking a specified resource.
