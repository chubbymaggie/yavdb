  title: SQL Injection
  description: |
    [org.marker:mrcms][1] is a Java-based dynamic content management system.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SQL Injection via
    the `getChannel()` method. The `WebParam.java` file directly accepts the
    `FIELD_T` parameter in a request and uses it as a hash of SQL statements
    without filtering which may result in SQL Injection.
