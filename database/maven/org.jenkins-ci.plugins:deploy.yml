  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:deploy][1] permits Jenkins to Deploy into
    containers and application servers.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. It allowed users with Jenkins master local file system access,
    or users with Extended Read access to the jobs it is used in, to
    retrieve those passwords. The Deploy to container Plugin now integrates
    with Credentials Plugin to store passwords securely, and automatically
    migrates existing passwords.
