  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [com.soasta.jenkins:cloudtest][1] is a Jenkins plugin that provides the
    ability to easily run the MakeAppTouchTestable utility on an iOS or
    Android project.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). A missing permission check in a form validation method
    allows users with Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test
    to an attacker-specified URL with attacker-specified credentials and SSH
    key store options. The form validation method does not require POST
    requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.
