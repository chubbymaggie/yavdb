  title: Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  description: |
    [com.acunetix:acunetix][1] package that allows you to trigger automated
    Acunetix scans as part of your web application’s build process inside of
    Jenkins.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server-side Request
    Forgery (SSRF). A missing permission check in a form validation method
    in Acunetix Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read permission to
    initiate a connection test, sending an HTTP GET request to an
    attacker-specified URL, adding a /me suffix, returning whether the
    connection could be established and whether the HTTP response code is
    200.

    scans as part of your web application’s build process inside of Jenkins.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information

    in its global configuration file on the Jenkins master. This key could
    be viewed by users with access to the master file system.
