  title: Access Control Bypass
  description: |
    [org.openmrs.module:htmlformentry-omod][1] is a HTML Form Entry that
    allows anyone with basic HTML programming skills and a knowledge of the
    OpenMRS system to create forms.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Control
    Bypass. The Manage Forms property within
    `HtmlFormFromFileController.java` was found to have insufficient access
    control which could result in authorisation bypass.
