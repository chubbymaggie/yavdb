  title: Cryptographic Issues
  description: |
    [`org.apache.myfaces.commons:myfaces-commons`][1]
    shared/util/StateUtils.java in Apache MyFaces 1.1.x before 1.1.8, 1.2.x
    before 1.2.9, and 2.0.x before 2.0.1 uses an encrypted View State
    without a Message Authentication Code (MAC), which makes it easier for
    remote attackers to perform successful modifications of the View State
    via a padding oracle attack.
