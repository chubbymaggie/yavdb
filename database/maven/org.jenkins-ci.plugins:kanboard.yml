  title: Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:kanboard][1] is a Jenkins plugin that allows to
    create or update a Kanboard task as a post-build action, trigger a build
    when a task is created or moved, and fetch a task and its attachments as
    a build step.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server-side Request
    Forgery (SSRF). An attacker with `Overall/Read` permission could submit
    a `GET` request to an attacker-specified URL.
