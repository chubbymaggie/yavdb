  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:pipeline-build-step][1] allows to add various
    Docker commands as a build step.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. It is associated with an authentication that controls the
    permissions that the build has to interact with other elements in
    Jenkins. The Pipeline: Build Step Plugin did not check the build
    authentication it was running as and allowed triggering any other
    project in Jenkins.
