  title: Code Injection
  description: |
    [`org.apache.geronimo.gshell:gshell-embeddable`][1] Affected versions of
    the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code Injection. It was found
    that XStream could deserialize arbitrary user-supplied XML content,
    representing objects of any type. A remote attacker able to pass XML to
    XStream could use this flaw to perform a variety of attacks, including
    remote code execution in the context of the server running the XStream
    application.
