  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [com.blackducksoftware.integration:blackduck-hub][1] supplies shared
    utilities across many integrations with Black Duck Software products.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF) via the `PostBuildScanDescriptor.java` method. An
    attacker with `Overall/Read` access could connect to an
    attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained
    through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

  title: Improper Authorization
  description: |
    [com.blackducksoftware.integration:blackduck-hub][1] provides ability to
    run a scan using the BD Hub CLI on build input and/or output.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    Authorization via the `PostBuildScanDescriptor.java` method. User with
    `Overall/Read` permission could read and write the Black Duck Hub plugin
    configuration.

  title: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
  description: |+
    [com.blackducksoftware.integration:blackduck-hub][1] provides ability to
    run a scan using the BD Hub CLI on build input and/or output.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to XML External Entity
    (XXE) Injection via the `PostBuildScanDescriptor.java` method. An
    attacker with `Overall/Read` permission to make Jenkins process XML
    eternal entities in an XML document.



    [1]: https://github.com/jenkinsci/blackduck-hub-plugin
    \nXXE Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML
    input. XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding
    documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
    By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external
    entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing.
    When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and
    include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.

    Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive
    data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or
    relative paths in the system identifier.

    For example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element-
    username.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
           <username>John</username>
        </xml>

    An external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and
    present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or
    remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML
    entity that would fetch the content of `/etc/passwd` and display it to
    the user rendered by `username`.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
        <!DOCTYPE foo [
           <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
           <username>&xxe;</username>
        </xml>

    Other XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop
    returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading
    to Denial of Service.
