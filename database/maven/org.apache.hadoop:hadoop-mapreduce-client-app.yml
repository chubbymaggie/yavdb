  description: Apache Hadoop 2.6.x encrypts intermediate data generated by a MapReduce
    job and stores it along with the encryption key in a credentials file on disk
    when the Intermediate data encryption feature is enabled, which allows local users
    to obtain sensitive information by reading the file.

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-mapreduce-client-app][1] is a software
    framework for distributed processing of large data sets on compute
    clusters of commodity hardware.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. It encrypts intermediate data generated by a MapReduce job and
    stores it along with the encryption key in a credentials file on disk
    when the Intermediate data encryption feature is enabled, which allows
    local users to obtain sensitive information by reading the file.
