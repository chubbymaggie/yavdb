  description: Apache Hadoop 2.6.x encrypts intermediate data generated by a MapReduce
    job and stores it along with the encryption key in a credentials file on disk
    when the Intermediate data encryption feature is enabled, which allows local users
    to obtain sensitive information by reading the file.
