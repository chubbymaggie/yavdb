  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [`org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-main`][1] is a framework that allows for the
    distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers
    using simple programming models.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege escalation
    attacks. In Apache Hadoop versions 2.6.1 to 2.6.5, 2.7.0 to 2.7.3, and
    3.0.0-alpha1, if a file in an encryption zone with access permissions
    that make it world readable is localized via YARN\'s localization
    mechanism, that file will be stored in a world-readable location and can
    be shared freely with any application that requests to localize that
    file.
