  title: Wrong security context loaded when using SAML2 STS Login Module
  description: "> It was discovered that when dealing with undefined security domains,
    the org.jboss.security.plugins.mapping.JBossMappingManager implementation would
    fall back to the default security domain if available. A user with valid credentials
    in the defined default domain, with a role that is valid in the expected application
    domain, can perform actions that was otherwise not available to them. When using
    the SAML2 STS Login Module, JBossMappingManager exposes this issue since PicketLink
    Trust SecurityActions implementation use a hardcoded default value when defining
    the context.\n> \n> -- [redhat.com](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=CVE-2014-7827)"

  title: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
  description: |+
    [`org.picketlink:picketlink-core`][1] The
    org.picketlink.common.util.DocumentUtil.getDocumentBuilderFactory method
    in PicketLink, as used in Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
    (JBEAP) 5.2.0 and 6.2.4, expands entity references, which allows remote
    attackers to read arbitrary code and possibly have other unspecified
    impact via unspecified vectors, related to an XML External Entity (XXE)
    issue.



    [1]: http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22picketlink-core%22
    \nXXE Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML
    input. XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding
    documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
    By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external
    entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing.
    When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and
    include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.

    Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive
    data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or
    relative paths in the system identifier.

    For example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element-
    username.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
           <username>John</username>
        </xml>

    An external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and
    present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or
    remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML
    entity that would fetch the content of `/etc/passwd` and display it to
    the user rendered by `username`.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
        <!DOCTYPE foo [
           <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
           <username>&xxe;</username>
        </xml>

    Other XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop
    returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading
    to Denial of Service.
