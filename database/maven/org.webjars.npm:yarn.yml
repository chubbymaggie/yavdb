  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:yarn][1] is a Fast, reliable, and secure dependency
    management.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM). Npm credentials such as `_authToken` were found to be sent over
    clear text when processing scoped packages that are listed as resolved.
    This could allow a suitably positioned attacker to eavesdrop and
    compromise the sent credentials.
