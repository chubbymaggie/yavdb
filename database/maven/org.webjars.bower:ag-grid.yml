  title: HTML Injection
  description: |
    [`ag-grid`][1] is an advanced Data Grid / Data Table supporting
    Javascript / React / AngularJS / Web Components.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to HTML Injection.
    `ag-grid` used mozilla\'s `Element.innerHTML`, which is vulnerable to
    Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks when used within a user-inputted
    value. In this case an attacker could insert a malicious username and
    initiate a XSS attack, like:

        <span onclick="alert('hacked!')">John Smith</span>
    {: .language-html}
