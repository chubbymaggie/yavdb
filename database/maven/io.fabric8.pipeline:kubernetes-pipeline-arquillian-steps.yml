  title: Sandbox Bypass
  description: |
    [io.fabric8.pipeline:kubernetes-pipeline-arquillian-steps][1] is a
    Kubernetes Pipeline Arquillian Steps Jenkins plugin.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Sandbox Bypass. The
    plugin was found to provide a custom whitelist for script security that
    allowed attackers to invoke arbitrary methods, bypassing typical sandbox
    protection.
