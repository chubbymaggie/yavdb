  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [org.apache.hbase:hbase-rest][1] is an open-source, distributed,
    versioned, non-relational database.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation. Authorization was incorrectly applied to users of the HBase
    REST server. Requests sent to the HBase REST server were executed with
    the permissions of the REST server itself, not with the permissions of
    the end-user.

    This issue is only relevant when HBase is configured with Kerberos
    authentication, HBase authorization is enabled, and the REST server is
    configured with `SPNEGO` authentication.
