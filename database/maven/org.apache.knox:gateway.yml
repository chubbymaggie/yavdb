  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    Affected versions of [`org.apache.knox:gateway`][1] are vulnerable to
    Privilege Escalation. For versions of Apache Knox from 0.2.0 to 0.11.0 -
    an authenticated user may use a specially crafted URL to impersonate
    another user while accessing WebHDFS through Apache Knox. This may
    result in escalated privileges and unauthorized data access. While this
    activity is audit logged and can be easily associated with the
    authenticated user, this is still a serious security issue. All users
    are recommended to upgrade to the Apache Knox 0.12.0 release.
