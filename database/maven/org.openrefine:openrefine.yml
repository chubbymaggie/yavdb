  title: Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip)
  description: "[org.openrefine:openrefine][1] is a Java-based power tool that allows\nyou
    to load data, understand it, clean it up, reconcile it, and augment\nit with data
    coming from the web.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary
    File Write\nvia Archive Extraction (Zip Slip).\n\nIt is exploited using a specially
    crafted zip archive, that holds path\ntraversal filenames. When exploited, a filename
    in a malicious archive\nis concatenated to the target extraction directory, which
    results in the\nfinal path ending up outside of the target folder. For instance,
    a zip\nmay hold a file with a \\\"../../file.exe\\\" location and thus break out
    of\nthe target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is\noverwritten
    with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn\ninto an arbitrary
    code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a zip archive
    with one benign file and\none malicious file. Extracting the malicous file will
    result in\ntraversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/`\noverwriting
    the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n    \n    +2018-04-15 22:04:29 ..... 19 19 good.txt\n
    \   \n    +2018-04-15 22:04:42 ..... 20 20 ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys\n\n\n\n[1]:
