  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`org.apache.storm:storm`][1] is a free and open source distributed
    realtime computation system.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. It was found that under some situations and configurations of
    Apache Storm 1.x before 1.0.4 and 1.1.x before 1.1.1, it is
    theoretically possible for the owner of a topology to trick the
    supervisor to launch a worker as a different, non-root, user. In the
    worst case this could lead to secure credentials of the other user being
    compromised.
