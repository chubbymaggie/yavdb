  title: Improper Certificate Validation
  description: |
    [org.asynchttpclient:async-http-client-api][1] is a library for Async
    Http Client (AHC) API classes.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Certificate
    Validation. SSL/TLS certificate verification was found to be disabled
    under certain conditions where client certificates were used to
    establish encrypted communications. The package also did not verify that
    the server hostname matched the domain name in the subject\'s Common
    Name or subjectAltName field in X.509 certificates. This could allow a
    man-in-the-middle attacker to spoof an SSL server if they had a
    certificate that was valid for any domain name.
