  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:ease-plugin][1] is a Jenkins plugin to upload
    Android, Blackberry and iOS apps.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The plugin stores the username and password connection
    credentials in its configuration unencrypted in jobs\' `config.xml`
    files on the Jenkins master. This key could be viewed by users with
    Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.

    While masked from view using a password form field, the password was
    transferred in plain text to users when accessing the job configuration
    form.
