  title: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:ease-plugin][1] is a Jenkins plugin to upload
    Android, Blackberry and iOS apps.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficiently
    Protected Credentials. The plugin provides a list of applicable
    credential IDs to allow administrators configuring the plugin to select
    the one to use. This functionality did not check permissions, allowing
    any user with Overall/Read permission to get a list of valid credentials
    IDs.

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:ease-plugin][1] is a Jenkins plugin to upload
    Android, Blackberry and iOS apps.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The plugin stores the username and password connection
    credentials in its configuration unencrypted in jobs\' `config.xml`
    files on the Jenkins master. This key could be viewed by users with
    Extended Read permission, or access to the master file system.

    While masked from view using a password form field, the password was
    transferred in plain text to users when accessing the job configuration
    form.
