  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    Affected versions of [`org.apache.brooklyn:brooklyn`][1] are vulnerable
    to Arbitrary Code Execution.

    Apache Brooklyn uses the SnakeYAML library for parsing YAML inputs.
    SnakeYAML allows the use of YAML tags to indicate that SnakeYAML should
    unmarshal data to a Java type. In the default configuration in Brooklyn
    before 0.10.0, SnakeYAML will allow unmarshalling to any Java type
    available on the classpath. This could provide an authenticated user
    with a means to cause the JVM running Brooklyn to load and run Java code
    without detection by Brooklyn. Such code would have the privileges of
    the Java process running Brooklyn, including the ability to open files
    and network connections, and execute system commands. There is known to
    be a proof-of-concept exploit using this vulnerability.
