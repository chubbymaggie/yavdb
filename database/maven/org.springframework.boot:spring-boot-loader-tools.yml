  title: Symlink privilege escalation
  description: |
    Affected versions of
    [`org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-loader-tools`][1] are vulnerable
    to Symlink privilege escalation.

    Spring Boot supports an embedded launch script that can be used to
    easily run the application as a systemd or init.d linux service. The
    script included with Spring Boot 1.5.9 and earlier is susceptible to a
    symlink attack which allows the “run\_user” to overwrite and take
    ownership of any file on the same system.

    **Note:** In order to instigate the attack, the application must be
    installed as a service and the “run\_user” requires shell access to the
    server.
