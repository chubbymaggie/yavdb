  title: Symlink privilege escalation
  description: |
    [org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-loader-tools][1] is a for Spring
    Boot Loader Tools.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Symlink privilege
    escalation. Spring Boot supports an embedded launch script that can be
    used to easily run the application as a systemd or init.d linux service.
    The script included with Spring Boot 1.5.9 and earlier is susceptible to
    a symlink attack which allows the “run\_user” to overwrite and take
    ownership of any file on the same system.

    **Note:** In order to instigate the attack, the application must be
    installed as a service and the “run\_user” requires shell access to the
    server.
