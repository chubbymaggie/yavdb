  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [net.sf.robocode:robocode][1] is a programming game, where the goal is
    to develop a robot battle tank to battle against other tanks in Java or
    .NET. The robot battles are running in real-time and on-screen.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation. An attacker could cause external service interaction (DNS),
    as demonstrated by a query for a unique subdomain name within an
    attacker-controlled DNS zone, because of a `.openStream` call within
    `java.net.URL`.
