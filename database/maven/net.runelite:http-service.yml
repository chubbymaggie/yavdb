  title: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
  description: |
    [net.runelite:http-service][1] is an open source OldSchool RuneScape
    client.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to XML External Entity
    (XXE) Injection via Man in the middle services. The package insecurely
    parses user-supplied XML content that can cause the disclosure of
    confidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery, port
    scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is
    located, and other system impacts.
