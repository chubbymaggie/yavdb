  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`org.richfaces.framework:richfaces-impl-jsf2`][1]
    ResourceBuilderImpl.java in the RichFaces 3.x through 5.x implementation
    in Red Hat JBoss Web Framework Kit before 2.3.0, Red Hat JBoss Web
    Platform through 5.2.0, Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform
    through 4.3.0 CP10 and 5.x through 5.2.0, Red Hat JBoss BRMS through
    5.3.1, Red Hat JBoss SOA Platform through 4.3.0 CP05 and 5.x through
    5.3.1, Red Hat JBoss Portal through 4.3 CP07 and 5.x through 5.2.2, and
    Red Hat JBoss Operations Network through 2.4.2 and 3.x through 3.1.2
    does not restrict the classes for which deserialization methods can be
    called, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via
    crafted serialized data.

  title: 'JBoss RichFaces: Remote code execution due to insecure deserialization'
  description: 'A flaw was found in the way JBoss RichFaces handled deserialization.
    A  remote attacker could use this flaw to trigger the execution of the  deserialization
    methods in any serializable class deployed on the server.  This could lead to
    a variety of security impacts depending on the  deserialization logic of these
    classes.
