    is one of the most pernicious vulnerabilities we’ve seen.\n> By merely existing

    it would be like\n> hiring a bank teller who was trained to hand over all the
    money in the\n> vault if asked to do so politely, and then entrusting that teller
    with\n> the key. The only thing that would keep a bank safe in such a\n> circumstance
    is that most people wouldn’t consider asking such a\n> question.\n> \n> * Google\n\n\n\n[1]:
