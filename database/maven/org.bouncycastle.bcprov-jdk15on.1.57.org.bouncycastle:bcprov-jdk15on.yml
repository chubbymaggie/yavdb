  title: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  description: |
    [org.bouncycastle.bcprov-jdk15on.1.57.org.bouncycastle:bcprov-jdk15on][1]
    is a Java implementation of Bouncy Castle cryptographic algorithms. This
    jar contains JCE provider and lightweight API for the Bouncy Castle
    Cryptography APIs for JDK 1.5 to JDK 1.8.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of
    Untrusted Data via the `XMSS/XMSS^MT` private key deserialization. A
    handcrafted private key could include references to unexpected classes
    which would be picked up from the class path for the executing
    application.
