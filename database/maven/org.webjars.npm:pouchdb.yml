  title: Safely allocate attachment buffers in PouchDB/Node.js
  description: "> Due to [Buffer (number) is unsafe](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/4660)
    in Node and PouchDB's usage of the now-deprecated [Buffer(number) constructor](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v4.x/docs/api/buffer.html#buffer_new_buffer_size)
    for attachments, PouchDB attachment buffers allocate potentially uninitialized
    memory via `malloc` from the Node.js process. These buffers may contain data left
    over from GC'd / freed heap memory from other parts of the Node.js process, and
    may lead to exploitable memory corruption if Buffer() types are not properly checked
    in PouchDB.\n> \n> -- [https://github.com](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/5531)"

  title: Arbitrary Code Injection
  description: "> An arbitrary code injection vector was found in PouchDB 5.4.5 and
    lesser via the map/reduce functions used in PouchDB temporary views and design
    documents. The code execution engine for this branch is not properly sandboxed
    and may be used to run arbitrary JavaScript as well as system commands.\n> \n>
