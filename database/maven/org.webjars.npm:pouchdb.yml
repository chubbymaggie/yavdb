  title: Safely allocate attachment buffers in PouchDB/Node.js
  description: "> Due to [Buffer (number) is unsafe](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/4660)
    in Node and PouchDB's usage of the now-deprecated [Buffer(number) constructor](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v4.x/docs/api/buffer.html#buffer_new_buffer_size)
    for attachments, PouchDB attachment buffers allocate potentially uninitialized
    memory via `malloc` from the Node.js process. These buffers may contain data left
    over from GC'd / freed heap memory from other parts of the Node.js process, and
    may lead to exploitable memory corruption if Buffer() types are not properly checked
    in PouchDB.\n> \n> -- [https://github.com](https://github.com/pouchdb/pouchdb/issues/5531)"
