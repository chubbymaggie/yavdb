  title: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  description: "[com.javapentesting:dozersploit][1] is a Java Bean to Java Bean mapper\nthat
    recursively copies data from one object to another.\n\nAffected versions of this
    package are vulnerable to Deserialization of\nUntrusted Data. An attacker could
    execute arbitrary code via a crafted\nserialized object.\n\n\n\n[1]: http://dozer.sourceforge.net/\n\\nSerialization
    is a process of converting an object into a sequence of\nbytes which can be persisted
    to a disk or database or can be sent\nthrough streams. The reverse process of
    creating object from sequence of\nbytes is called deserialization. Serialization
    is commonly used for\ncommunication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and
    persistence\n(store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral
    part\nof popular protocols like *Remote Method Invocation (RMI)*, *Java\nManagement
    Extension (JMX)*, *Java Messaging System (JMS)*, *Action\nMessage Format (AMF)*,
    *Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState*, etc.\n\n*Deserialization of untrusted data*
    ([CWE-502][1]), is when the\napplication deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently
    verifying\nthat the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control\nthe
    state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known
    for years. However, interest\nin the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes
    that could be\nabused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular
    library\n(Apache Commons Collection)][2]. These classes were used in zero-days\naffecting
    IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\nAn attacker just needs
    to identify a piece of software that has both a\nvulnerable class on its path,
    and performs deserialization on untrusted\ndata. Then all they need to do is send
    the payload into the\ndeserializer, getting the command executed.\n\n> Developers
    put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even\n> de-serialize objects
    pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object\n> in Java you typically cast
    it to an expected type, and therefore\n> Java\\'s strict type system will ensure
    you only get valid object\n> trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking
    happens, platform\n> code has already created and executed significant logic.
    So, before\n> the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the\n>
    readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the\n> developer\\'s
    control. By combining the readObject() methods of various\n> classes which are
    available on the classpath of the vulnerable\n> application an attacker can execute
    functions (including calling\n> Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n>
    \n> * Apache Blog\n\nThe vulnerability, also know as *Mad Gadget*\n\n> Mad Gadget
    is one of the most pernicious vulnerabilities we’ve seen.\n> By merely existing
    on the Java classpath, seven “gadget” classes in\n> Apache Commons Collections
    (versions 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.2.1, and 4.0)\n> make object deserialization for the
    entire JVM process Turing complete\n> with an exec function. Since many business
    applications use object\n> deserialization to send messages across the network,
    it would be like\n> hiring a bank teller who was trained to hand over all the
    money in the\n> vault if asked to do so politely, and then entrusting that teller
    with\n> the key. The only thing that would keep a bank safe in such a\n> circumstance
    is that most people wouldn’t consider asking such a\n> question.\n> \n> * Google\n\n\n\n[1]:
