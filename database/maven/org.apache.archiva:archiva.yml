  description: |+
    [`org.apache.archiva:archiva`][1] Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
    vulnerability in Apache Continuum 1.1 through 1.2.3.1, 1.3.6, and 1.4.0
    Beta; and Archiva 1.3.0 through 1.3.3 and 1.0 through 1.22 allows remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via a crafted
    parameter, related to the autoIncludeParameters setting for the
    extremecomponents table.



    [1]: http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22archiva%22
    \nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker tricks a
    user’s browser to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a
    victim’s domain. Such scripts can steal the user’s session cookies for
    the domain, scrape or modify its content, and perform or modify actions
    on the user’s behalf, actions typically blocked by the browser’s Same
    Origin Policy.

    These attacks are possible by escaping the context of the web
    application and injecting malicious scripts in an otherwise trusted
    website. These scripts can introduce additional attributes (say, a
    \"new\" option in a dropdown list or a new link to a malicious site) and
    can potentially execute code on the clients side, unbeknown to the
    victim. This occurs when characters like `<` `>` `"` `'` are not escaped
    properly.

    There are a few types of XSS:

    * **Persistent XSS** is an attack in which the malicious code persists
      into the web app’s database.
    * **Reflected XSS** is an which the website echoes back a portion of the
      request. The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking a
      malicious link (for instance through a phishing email or malicious JS
      on another page), which triggers the XSS attack.
    * **DOM-based XSS** is an that occurs purely in the browser when
      client-side JavaScript echoes back a portion of the URL onto the page.
      DOM-Based XSS is notoriously hard to detect, as the server never gets
      a chance to see the attack taking place.

    [`org.apache.archiva:archiva`][1] Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
    vulnerability in Apache Archiva 1.3.9 and earlier allows remote
    authenticated administrators to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
    the connector.sourceRepoId parameter to
    admin/addProxyConnector\_commit.action.

    \nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker tricks a
    user’s browser to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a
    victim’s domain. Such scripts can steal the user’s session cookies for
    the domain, scrape or modify its content, and perform or modify actions
    on the user’s behalf, actions typically blocked by the browser’s Same
    Origin Policy.

    These attacks are possible by escaping the context of the web
    application and injecting malicious scripts in an otherwise trusted
    website. These scripts can introduce additional attributes (say, a
    \"new\" option in a dropdown list or a new link to a malicious site) and
    can potentially execute code on the clients side, unbeknown to the
    victim. This occurs when characters like `<` `>` `"` `'` are not escaped
    properly.

    There are a few types of XSS:

    * **Persistent XSS** is an attack in which the malicious code persists
      into the web app’s database.
    * **Reflected XSS** is an which the website echoes back a portion of the
      request. The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking a
      malicious link (for instance through a phishing email or malicious JS
      on another page), which triggers the XSS attack.
    * **DOM-based XSS** is an that occurs purely in the browser when
      client-side JavaScript echoes back a portion of the URL onto the page.
      DOM-Based XSS is notoriously hard to detect, as the server never gets
      a chance to see the attack taking place.

  description: |+
    Affected versions of [`org.apache.archiva:archiva`][1] are vulnerable to
    Cross-site Scripting (XSS) attacks. Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
    vulnerability in Apache Archiva 1.2 through 1.2.2 and 1.3 before 1.3.8
    allows remote attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via
    unspecified parameters, related to the home page.

  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    Affected versions of [`org.apache.archiva:archiva`][1] are vulnerable to
    Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF). Several REST service endpoints of
    Apache Archiva are not protected against Cross Site Request Forgery
    (CSRF) attacks. A malicious site opened in the same browser as the
    archiva site, may send an HTML response that performs arbitrary actions
    on archiva services, with the same rights as the active archiva session
    (e.g. administrator rights).
