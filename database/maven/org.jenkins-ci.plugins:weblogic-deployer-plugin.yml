  title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:weblogic-deployer-plugin][1] is a Jenkins plugin
    to deploy some artifacts to a Weblogic server.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). The plugin does not perform permission checks on a
    method implementing form validation. This allows users with
    `Overall/Read` access to Jenkins to send an HTTP HEAD request to a
    user-specified URL, or confirm the existence of any file or directory on
    the Jenkins master. Additionally, the form validation method does not
    require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF vulnerability. This
    vulnerability is also related to `CVE-2019-10465`
