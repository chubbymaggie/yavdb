  title: Improper Certificate Validation
  description: |
    [rg.jenkins-ci.plugins:active-directory][1] is a Next Generation
    Warnings plugin which collects compiler warnings or issues reported by
    static analysis tools and visualizes the results.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Certificate
    Validation. An attacker could impersonate the Active Directory server
    Jenkins connects to for authentication if Jenkins is configured to use
    `StartTLS`.
