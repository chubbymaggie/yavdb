  title: Directory Traversal
  description: |
    [`org.apache.wicket:wicket-core`][1] Directory traversal vulnerability
    in Apache Wicket 1.4.x before 1.4.20 and 1.5.x before 1.5.5 allows
    remote attackers to read arbitrary web-application files via a relative
    pathname in a URL for a Wicket resource that corresponds to a null
    package.



    [1]: http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22wicket-core%22
    \nA Directory Traversal attack (also known as path traversal) aims to
    access files and directories that are stored outside the intended
    folder. By manipulating files with \"dot-dot-slash (../)\" sequences and
    its variations, or by using absolute file paths, it may be possible to
    access arbitrary files and directories stored on file system, including
    application source code, configuration, and other critical system files.

    Directory Traversal vulnerabilities can be generally divided into two
    types:

    * **Information Disclosure**\: Allows the attacker to gain information
      about the folder structure or read the contents of sensitive files on
      the system.

    `st` is a module for serving static files on web pages, and contains a
    [vulnerability of this type][1]. In our example, we will serve files
    from the `public` route.

    If an attacker requests the following URL from our server, it will in
    turn leak the sensitive private key of the root user.

        curl http://localhost:8080/public/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/root/.ssh/id_rsa

    **Note** `%2e` is the URL encoded version of `.` (dot).

    * **Writing arbitrary files**\: Allows the attacker to create or replace
      existing files. This type of vulnerability is also known as
      `Zip-Slip`.

    One way to achieve this is by using a malicious `zip` archive that holds
    path traversal filenames. When each filename in the zip archive gets
    concatenated to the target extraction folder, without validation, the
    final path ends up outside of the target folder. If an executable or a
    configuration file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code,
    the problem can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite
    easily.

    The following is an example of a `zip` archive with one benign file and
    one malicious file. Extracting the malicious file will result in
    traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/`
    overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

        2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt
        2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys

    \nWhen rendering a web page Wicket checks the request url against the one
    at the render time. It is possible the application to change the page
    parameters (this includes both the query parameters and parameters
    encoded into the request path). When the requested url differs with the
    one at the rendering time Wicket stores the response (i.e. the page
    markup) at the server side and issues an HTTP redirect to the new url.
    When the second request comes Wicket just flushes the stored response
    from the first request into the http output stream. This way the browser
    address bar shows the updated page parameters. When storing the page
    markup at the server side Wicket uses as an identifier a pair of the
    current session id plus the new url. However, Wicket does not check if
    user session is temporary (i.e. sessionId is null). This could lead to a
    security issue if two or more users with a temporary session are
    redirected to the same url at the same time. Then user1 might see the
    markup for user2 which has overridden the markup for user1 while user1
    was following the HTTP redirect. In this way user-sensitive informations
    can be seen by other users.

    [1]: http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22wicket-core%22
    \nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker tricks a
    user’s browser to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a
    victim’s domain. Such scripts can steal the user’s session cookies for
    the domain, scrape or modify its content, and perform or modify actions
    on the user’s behalf, actions typically blocked by the browser’s Same
    Origin Policy.

    These attacks are possible by escaping the context of the web
    application and injecting malicious scripts in an otherwise trusted
    website. These scripts can introduce additional attributes (say, a
    \"new\" option in a dropdown list or a new link to a malicious site) and
    can potentially execute code on the clients side, unbeknown to the
    victim. This occurs when characters like `<` `>` `"` `'` are not escaped
    properly.

    There are a few types of XSS:

    * **Persistent XSS** is an attack in which the malicious code persists
      into the web app’s database.
    * **Reflected XSS** is an which the website echoes back a portion of the
      request. The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking a
      malicious link (for instance through a phishing email or malicious JS
      on another page), which triggers the XSS attack.
    * **DOM-based XSS** is an that occurs purely in the browser when
      client-side JavaScript echoes back a portion of the URL onto the page.
      DOM-Based XSS is notoriously hard to detect, as the server never gets
      a chance to see the attack taking place.

  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [`org.apache.wicket:wicket-core`][1] Affected versions of Apache Wicket
    provide a CSRF prevention measure that fails to discover some cross
    origin requests. The mitigation is to not only check the Origin HTTP
    header, but also take the Referer HTTP header into account when no
    Origin was provided. Furthermore, not all Wicket server side targets
    were subjected to the CSRF check. This was also fixed.
