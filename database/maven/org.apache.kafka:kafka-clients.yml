  title: Cryptographic Issues - Insufficient Entropy
  description: |
    [org.apache.kafka:kafka-clients][1] is a streaming platform that can
    publish and subscribe to streams of records, store streams of records in
    a fault-tolerant durable way, and process streams of records as they
    occur.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cryptographic Issues
    - Insufficient Entropy because in the ExpiringCredentialRefreshingLogin,
    the number generated by Random has a low entropy therefore more
    predictable.
