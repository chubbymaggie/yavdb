  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:audit2db][1] is a plugin that provides database
    audit functionality to Jenkins.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). A missing permission check in a form validation method
    in Audit to Database Plugin allows users with Overall/Read permission to
    initiate a JDBC database connection test to an attacker-specified server
    with attacker-specified credentials.

    Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
    resulting in a CSRF vulnerability.

  title: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:audit2db][1] is a plugin that provides database
    audit functionality to Jenkins.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficiently
    Protected Credentials. The plugin stores credentials unencrypted in its
    global configuration file `audit2db.xml` on the Jenkins master system
    where they can be viewed by users with access to the master file system.
