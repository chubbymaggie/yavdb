    [de.tracetronic.jenkins.plugins:ecutest][1] integrates Jenkins with
    ECU-TEST and generates reports on automated test execution.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF) via the `ATXPublisher.java` class. It did not perform
    permission checks on a method implementing form validation. This form
