  title: Authorization Bypass
  description: |
    [org.springframework.security:spring-security-oauth2-jose][1] provides
    security services for the Spring IO Platform.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authorization Bypass
    via the JWT issuer validator. An attacker could fashion signed JWTs with
    the malicious issuer URL that may be granted for the honest issue. In
    order to be impacted, the same private key for an honest issuer and a
    malicious user must be used when signing JWTs.
