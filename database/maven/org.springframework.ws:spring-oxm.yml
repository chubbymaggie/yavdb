  title: '[CVE-2014-0225]  Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference ("XXE")'
  description: When processing user provided XML documents, the Spring Framework 4.0.0
    to 4.0.4, 3.0.0 to 3.2.8, and possibly earlier unsupported versions did not disable
    by default the resolution of URI references in a DTD declaration. This enabled
    an XXE attack.
