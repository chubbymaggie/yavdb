  title: Access Control Bypass
  description: |
    [org.jvnet.hudson.plugins:ftppublisher][1] is a Jenkins plugin used to
    upload project artifacts and whole directories to an ftp server.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Control
    Bypass. A missing permission check in a form validation method allows
    users with Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test to an
    attacker-specified FTP server with attacker-specified credentials.
    Additionally, the form validation method does not require POST requests,
    resulting in a CSRF vulnerability (CVE-2019-1003058).

  title: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
  description: |
    [org.jvnet.hudson.plugins:ftppublisher][1] is a Jenkins plugin used to
    upload project artifacts and whole directories to an ftp server.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficiently
    Protected Credentials. Credentials are stored unencrypted in the
    plugin\'s global configuration file
    `com.zanox.hudson.plugins.FTPPublisher.xml` on the Jenkins master
    system. These credentials can be viewed by users with access to the
    master file system.

  title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jvnet.hudson.plugins:ftppublisher][1] is a Jenkins plugin used to
    upload project artifacts and whole directories to an ftp server.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). The form validation method used by the plugin does not
    require POST requests, and is predictable resulting in a CSRF
    vulnerability. This vulnerability could be leveraged with
    CVE-2019-1003059 to trick a user into initiating a connection test to an
    attacker-specified FTP server with attacker-specified credentials.
