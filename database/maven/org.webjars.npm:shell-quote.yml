  title: Command Injection
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:shell-quote][1] is a package used to quote and parse
    shell commands.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Command Injection.
    The `quote` function does not properly escape the following special
    characters `<`, `>`, `;`, `{`, `}` , and as a result can be used by an
    attacker to inject malicious shell commands or leak sensitive
    information.
