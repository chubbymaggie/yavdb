  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:gitlab-plugin][1] allows GitLab to trigger
    builds in Jenkins when code is committed or merge requests are opened /
    updated. It can also send build status back to GitLab.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF) due to lack of permission checks on the form validation.
    A malicious user with Overall/Read access could connect to an
    attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained
    through another method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.
    Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests.
    This validation process now requires POST requests and
    Overall/Administer permissions.
