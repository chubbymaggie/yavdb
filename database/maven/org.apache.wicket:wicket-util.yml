  title: "[CVE-2016-6793] The DiskFileItem class in Apache Wicket 6.x before 6.25.0
    and 1.5.x before 1.5.7..."
  description: The DiskFileItem class in Apache Wicket 6.x before 6.25.0 and 1.5.x
    before 1.5.7 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service (infinite loop)
    and write to, move, and delete files with the permissions of DiskFileItem, and
    if running on a Java VM before 1.3.1, execute arbitrary code via a crafted serialized
    Java object.

  title: Inadequate Encryption Strength
  description: |
    [`org.apache.wicket:wicket-util`][1] Affected versions of the package
    are vulnerable to Inadequate Encryption Strength. With Wicket\'s default
    security settings the usage of CryptoMapper to encrypt/obfuscate pages\'
    urls is not strong enough. It is possible to predict the encrypted
    version of an url based on the previous history.

  title: Deserialization of untrusted data
  description: |
    [`org.apache.wicket:wicket-util`][1] Affected versions of the package
    are vulnerable to Deserialization of untrusted data. Depending on the
    ISerializer set in the Wicket application, it\'s possible that a
    Wicket\'s object deserialized from an untrusted source and utilized by
    the application to causes the code to enter in an infinite loop.
    Specifically, Wicket\'s DiskFileItem class, serialized by Kryo, allows
    an attacker to hack its serialized form to put a client on an infinite
    loop if the client attempts to write on the DeferredFileOutputStream
    attribute.
