  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`org.jbehave:jbehave-core`][1] Affected versions of the package are
    vulnerable to Remote Code Execution. It was found that XStream could
    deserialize arbitrary user-supplied XML content, representing objects of
    any type. A remote attacker able to pass XML to XStream could use this
    flaw to perform a variety of attacks, including remote code execution in
    the context of the server running the XStream application.
