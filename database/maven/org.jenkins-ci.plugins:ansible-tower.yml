  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:ansible-tower][1] gives you the ability to run
    Ansible Tower jobs as a build step.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). Ansible Tower Plugin did not perform permission checks
    on a method implementing form validation. This allowed users with
    Overall/Read access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL
    using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another
    method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins.

    Additionally, this form validation method did not require POST requests,
    resulting in a cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

  title: Missing Permission Check
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:ansible-tower][1] gives you the ability to run
    Ansible Tower jobs as a build step.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Missing Permission
    Check. The method
    `TowerInstallationDescriptor#doFillTowerCredentialsIdItems` allows
    attackers with Overall/Read permission to enumerate credentials ID of
    credentials stored in Jenkins.
