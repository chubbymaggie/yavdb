  title: HTML reflection vulnerability in 500 error status handler (XSS)
  description: Certain IO errors containing the requested path can be echoed directly
    back to the user without a Content-Type header. In some cases, browsers' sniffing
    can result in the document being treated as HTML, allowing XSS. This is resolved
    by sending a Content-Type header of text/plain.
