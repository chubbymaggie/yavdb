  title: HTML reflection vulnerability in 500 error status handler (XSS)
  description: Certain IO errors containing the requested path can be echoed directly
    back to the user without a Content-Type header. In some cases, browsers' sniffing
    can result in the document being treated as HTML, allowing XSS. This is resolved
    by sending a Content-Type header of text/plain.

  title: Possible Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
  description: A recent vulnerability `HTML reflection vulnerability in 500 error
    status handler` was resolved for Firefox, but potentially not in all browsers.
    Previous versions of Internet Explorer have aggressively sniffed `text/plain`
    content as `text/html` despite the header, and it may be possible to provoke this
    behaviour in current versions if compatibility modes are enabled. Bugs have also
    resulted in this behaviour in other browsers in some contexts, as recently as
    iOS 6 Safari.

  title: Cross Site Scripting (XSS) in directory listing code
  description: The directory listing code from nodejitsu's static server has some
    xss flaws since `req.url` comes directly from the user and hasn't been filtered
    at all.
