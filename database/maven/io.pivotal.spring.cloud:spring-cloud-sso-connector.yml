  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [io.pivotal.spring.cloud:spring-cloud-sso-connector][1] is a Spring
    Cloud Connector for use with the Pivotal Single Sign-On Service on Cloud
    Foundry.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. It disables issuer validation in resource servers that are not
    bound to the SSO service. A remote attacker can authenticate to unbound
    resource servers which use this version of the SSO Connector with tokens
    generated from another service plan.
