    [`org.bouncycastle:bcprov-ext-jdk14`][1] The TLS implementation in the
    Bouncy Castle Java library before 1.48 and C# library before 1.8 does
    not properly consider timing side-channel attacks on a noncompliant MAC
    check operation during the processing of malformed CBC padding, which
    allows remote attackers to conduct distinguishing attacks and
    plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical analysis of timing data for
    crafted packets, a related issue to [CVE-2013-0169][2].

    [`org.bouncycastle:bcprov-ext-jdk14`][1] The Bouncy Castle Java library
    before 1.51 does not validate a point is withing the elliptic curve,
    which makes it easier for remote attackers to obtain private keys via a
    series of crafted elliptic curve Diffie Hellman (ECDH) key exchanges,
    aka an \"invalid curve attack.\"
