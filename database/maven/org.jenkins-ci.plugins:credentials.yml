  title: Arbitrary File Read
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:credentials][1] is a plugin that provides a
    standardized API for other plugins to store and retrieve different types
    of credentials.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Read.
    The Credentials Plugin allowed the creation of Certificate credentials
    from a PKCS12 file on the Jenkins master. Users with permission to
    create or update credentials could use the associated form validation to
    confirm the existence of files with an attacker-specified path.

    Additionally, they could create credentials from any valid PKCS12 file
    on the Jenkins master. With the ability to configure jobs to access
    these credentials, they could obtain the certificate content.
