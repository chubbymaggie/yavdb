  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:vault-scm-plugin][1] is a plugin to integrate
    SourceGear Vault/Fortress version control with Jenkins

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficiently
    Protected Credentials. While an SCM password is stored it is transmitted
    in plain text as part of the configuration form, which can result in its
    exposure.
