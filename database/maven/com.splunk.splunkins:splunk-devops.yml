  title: Sandbox Bypass
  description: |
    [com.splunk.splunkins:splunk-devops][1] is a plugin that provides deep
    insights into your Jenkins master and slave infrastructure, job and
    build details.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Sandbox Bypass. An
    attacker with Overall/Read permission can provide a Groovy script to an
    HTTP endpoint that can result in arbitrary code execution on the Jenkins
    master JVM.
