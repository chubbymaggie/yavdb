  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:openstack-cloud][1] Provision slaves from
    OpenStack on demand.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. It did not perform permission checks on methods implementing
    form validation. A malicious user with `Overall/Read access` could
    connect to an attacker-specified URL, capture credentials stored in
    Jenkins, and to cause Jenkins to submit `HTTP` requests to
    attacker-specified URLs.
