    [`org.springframework.webflow:spring-webflow`][1] facilitates building
    web applications that require guided navigation.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Data Binding
    Expression Vulnerability due to setting the default value of the
    `MvcViewFactoryCreator useSpringBinding` property to `false`. If the
    application does not have a sub-element to declare explicit data binding
    property mappings, it can be vulnerable to malicious EL expressions in
    view states that process form submissions.

    [`org.springframework.webflow:spring-webflow`][1] facilitates building

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure defaults
    due to an incomplete fix for [CVE-2017-4971][2].

    An issue was discovered in Pivotal Spring Web Flow through 2.4.5.
    Applications that do not change the value of the `MvcViewFactoryCreator`
    `useSpringBinding` property which is disabled by default (i.e., set to
    \'false\') can be vulnerable to malicious EL expressions in view states
    that process form submissions but do not have a sub-element to declare
    explicit data binding property mappings.
