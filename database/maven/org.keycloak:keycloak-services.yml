  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`org.keycloak:keycloak-services`][1] Affected versions of the package
    are vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS). It was discovered that by
    requesting a large enough image size for a generated QR code in JBoss
    KeyCloak, a remote attacker could cause uncontrolled resource
    consumption leading to denial of service for legitimate users.



    [1]: http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22keycloak-services%22
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

    [`org.keycloak:keycloak-services`][1] Affected versions of the package
    are vulnerable to Open Redirect. It was identified that the login
    redirect implementation provided by JBoss KeyCloak did not validate the
    redirect URL. This flaw could be used by a remote attacker to conduct
    phishing attacks by redirecting users to arbitary websites.

  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: |+
    [`org.keycloak:keycloak-services`][1] Affected versions of the package
    are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting (XSS). If a JBoss Keycloak
    application was configured to use `*` as a permitted web origin in the
    Keycloak administrative console, crafted requests to the
    login-status-iframe.html endpoint could inject arbitrary Javascript into
    the generated HTML code via the \"origin\" query parameter, leading to a
    cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.



    [1]: http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22keycloak-services%22
    \nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker tricks a
    user’s browser to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a
    victim’s domain. Such scripts can steal the user’s session cookies for
    the domain, scrape or modify its content, and perform or modify actions
    on the user’s behalf, actions typically blocked by the browser’s Same
    Origin Policy.

    These attacks are possible by escaping the context of the web
    application and injecting malicious scripts in an otherwise trusted
    website. These scripts can introduce additional attributes (say, a
    \"new\" option in a dropdown list or a new link to a malicious site) and
    can potentially execute code on the clients side, unbeknown to the
    victim. This occurs when characters like `<` `>` `"` `'` are not escaped
    properly.

    There are a few types of XSS:

    * **Persistent XSS** is an attack in which the malicious code persists
      into the web app’s database.
    * **Reflected XSS** is an which the website echoes back a portion of the
      request. The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking a
      malicious link (for instance through a phishing email or malicious JS
      on another page), which triggers the XSS attack.
    * **DOM-based XSS** is an that occurs purely in the browser when
      client-side JavaScript echoes back a portion of the URL onto the page.
      DOM-Based XSS is notoriously hard to detect, as the server never gets
      a chance to see the attack taking place.

    It was found that Keycloak oauth would permit an authenticated resource
    to obtain an access/refresh token pair from the authentication server,
    permitting indefinite usage in the case of permission revocation. An
    attacker on an already compromised resource could use this flaw to grant
    himself continued permissions and possibly conduct further attacks
