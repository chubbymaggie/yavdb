  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [org.apache.jmeter:apachejmeter][1] is an open Source application
    designed to load test applications and measure performance.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM) attacks. When using Distributed Test only, Apache uses an
    unsecured RMI connection. This could allow an attacker to get Access to
    JMeterEngine and send unauthorized code.

  title: Host Spoofing
  description: |
    [org.apache.jmeter:ApacheJMeter][1] is an open Source application
    designed to load test applications and measure performance.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Host Spoofing. When
    using Distributed Test only (RMI based), jmeter server binds RMI
    Registry to wildcard host. This could allow an attacker to get Access to
    JMeterEngine and send unauthorized code.
