  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: "[`org.graniteds:granite-generator`][1] provides server and client\nlibraries
    that can be used to connect desktop and mobile applications to\na server using
    the AMF3 or JMF serialization protocols, through RPC\n(remoting) and different
    messaging technologies (Comet, WebSocket, UDP).\n\nAffected versions of the package
    are vulnerable to Deserialization of\nUntrusted Data. `AMF3` deserializers derives
    class instances from\n`java.io.Externalizable` rather than the `AMF3` specification\\'s\nrecommendation
    of `flash.utils.IExternalizable`. A remote attacker with\nthe ability to spoof
    or control an RMI server connection may be able to\nsend serialized Java objects
    that execute arbitrary code when\ndeserialized.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://graniteds.org\n\\nSerialization
    is a process of converting an object into a sequence of\nbytes which can be persisted
    to a disk or database or can be sent\nthrough streams. The reverse process of
    creating object from sequence of\nbytes is called deserialization. Serialization
    is commonly used for\ncommunication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and
    persistence\n(store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral
    part\nof popular protocols like *Remote Method Invocation (RMI)*, *Java\nManagement
    Extension (JMX)*, *Java Messaging System (JMS)*, *Action\nMessage Format (AMF)*,
    *Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState*, etc.\n\n*Deserialization of untrusted data*
    ([CWE-502][1]), is when the\napplication deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently
    verifying\nthat the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control\nthe
    state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known
    for years. However, interest\nin the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes
    that could be\nabused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular
    library\n(Apache Commons Collection)][2]. These classes were used in zero-days\naffecting
    IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\nAn attacker just needs
    to identify a piece of software that has both a\nvulnerable class on its path,
    and performs deserialization on untrusted\ndata. Then all they need to do is send
    the payload into the\ndeserializer, getting the command executed.\n\n> Developers
