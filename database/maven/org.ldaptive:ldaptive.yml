  title: Improper Certificate Validation
  description: |
    [`org.ldaptive:ldaptive`][1] It was discovered that the implementation
    used by the vtldap/ldaptive project to check that the server hostname
    matches the domain name in the subject\'s CN field was flawed. This can
    be exploited by a Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, where the attacker
    can spoof a valid certificate using a specially crafted subject.
