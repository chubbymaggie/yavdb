  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [`org.igniterealtime.smack:smack-core`][1] The ServerTrustManager
    component in the Ignite Realtime Smack XMPP API before 4.0.0-rc1 does
    not verify basicConstraints and nameConstraints in X.509 certificate
    chains from SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to
    spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted certificate
    chain.
