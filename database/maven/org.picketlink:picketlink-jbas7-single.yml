  description: 'The Service Provider (SP) in PicketLink before 2.7.0 does not ensure
    that it is a member of an Audience element when an AudienceRestriction is specified,
    which allows remote attackers to log in to other users'' accounts via a crafted
    SAML assertion.  NOTE: this identifier has been SPLIT per ADT2 due to different
    vulnerability types. See CVE-2015-6254 for lack of validation for the Destination
    attribute in a Response element in a SAML assertion.'
