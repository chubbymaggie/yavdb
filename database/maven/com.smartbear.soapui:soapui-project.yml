  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [com.smartbear.soapui:oapui-project][1] is an open-source web service
    testing application for service-oriented architectures (SOA) and
    representational state transfers (REST).

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. It allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary Java code via
    a crafted request parameter in a WSDL project file.

  title: 'SoapUI: remote code execution when processing WSDL'
  description: 'It was found that SoapUI would expand properties in WSDL files. A
    remote attacker, able to supply a WSDL file that would be processed by SoapUI,
    could supply arbitrary Groovy code in the property of a WSDL element. This property
    would be expanded, and the Groovy code executed, when the SoapUI client processed
    the WSDL.
