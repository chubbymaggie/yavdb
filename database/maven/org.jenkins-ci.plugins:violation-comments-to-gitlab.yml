  title: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:violation-comments-to-gitlab][1] is a Jenkins
    plugin that finds violations reported by code analyzers and comments
    GitLab merge requests with them.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficiently
    Protected Credentials. API tokens were found to be stored in plain text
    within job `config.xml` files and its global configuration file
    `org.jenkinsci.plugins.jvctgl.ViolationsToGitLabGlobalConfiguration.xml`
    on the Jenkins master. These credentials could be viewed by users with
    `Extended Read` permission, or access to the master file system.
