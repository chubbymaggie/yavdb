  title: Arbitrary Command Execution
  description: |
    [`org.apache.camel:camel-ahc`][1] is a versatile open-source integration
    framework based on known Enterprise Integration Patterns.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command
    Execution. Apache Camel 2.6.x through 2.14.x, 2.15.x before 2.15.5, and
    2.16.x before 2.16.1, when using (1) camel-jetty or (2) camel-servlet as
    a consumer in Camel routes, allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary
    commands via a crafted serialized Java object in an HTTP request.
