  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:email-ext][1] allows you to configure every
    aspect of email notifications.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. It could send emails to a dynamically created list of users
    based on the changelogs, like authors of SCM changes since the last
    successful build. This could result in emails being sent to people who
    have no user account in Jenkins.
