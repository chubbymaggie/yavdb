  title: Man in the Middle (MITM)
  description: |
    [org.eclipse.vorto:parent][1] is a package that allows device
    manufacturers to easily describe device functionality and
    characteristics as Device Information Models and share &amp; manage them
    in a central Vorto Repository.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man in the Middle
    (MITM). The resolving process of Maven build artifacts is over HTTP
    instead of HTTPS. Any of these dependent artifacts could have been
    maliciously compromised by a MITM attack.
