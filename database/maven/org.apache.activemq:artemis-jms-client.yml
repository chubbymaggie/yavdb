  title: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  description: "[`org.apache.activemq:artemis-jms-client`][1] is an open source\nmessaging
    and Integration Patterns server.\n\nThe getObject method of the javax.jms.ObjectMessage
    class in the (1) JMS\nCore client, (2) Artemis broker, and (3) Artemis REST component
    in\nApache ActiveMQ Artemis before 1.4.0 might allow remote authenticated\nusers
    with permission to send messages to the Artemis broker to\ndeserialize arbitrary
    objects and execute arbitrary code by leveraging\ngadget classes being present
    on the Artemis classpath.\n\n# Details   {#details}\n\nSerialization is a process
    of converting an object into a sequence of\nbytes which can be persisted to a
    disk or database or can be sent\nthrough streams. The reverse process of creating
    object from sequence of\nbytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly
    used for\ncommunication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence\n(store
    the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part\nof popular
    protocols like *Remote Method Invocation (RMI)*, *Java\nManagement Extension (JMX)*,
    *Java Messaging System (JMS)*, *Action\nMessage Format (AMF)*, *Java Server Faces
    (JSF) ViewState*, etc.\n\n*Deserialization of untrusted data* ([CWE-502][2]),
    is when the\napplication deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying\nthat
    the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control\nthe state or
    the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known for
    years. However, interest\nin the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes
    that could be\nabused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular
    library\n(Apache Commons Collection)][3]. These classes were used in zero-days\naffecting
    IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\nAn attacker just needs
    to identify a piece of software that has both a\nvulnerable class on its path,
    and performs deserialization on untrusted\ndata. Then all they need to do is send
    the payload into the\ndeserializer, getting the command executed.\n\n> Developers
    put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even\n> de-serialize objects
    pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object\n> in Java you typically cast
    it to an expected type, and therefore\n> Java\\'s strict type system will ensure
    you only get valid object\n> trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking
    happens, platform\n> code has already created and executed significant logic.
    So, before\n> the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the\n>
    readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the\n> developer\\'s
    control. By combining the readObject() methods of various\n> classes which are
    available on the classpath of the vulnerable\n> application an attacker can execute
    functions (including calling\n> Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n>
