  title: Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  description: |
    [`org.asynchttpclient:async-http-client`][1] is an Async Http Client
    (AHC) library\'s purpose is to allow Java applications to easily execute
    HTTP requests and asynchronously process the response.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Server Side Request
    Forgery (SSRF).

    Async Http Client (aka async-http-client) before 2.0.35 can be tricked
    into connecting to a host different from the one extracted by
    java.net.URI if a \'?\' character occurs in a fragment identifier.
    Similar bugs were previously identified in cURL (CVE-2016-8624) and
    Oracle Java 8 java.net.URL.
