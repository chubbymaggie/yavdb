  title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:libvirt-slave][1] is a Jenkins libvirt-slave
    plugin.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). The plugin does not perform permission checks on a
    method implementing form validation. This allows users with
    `Overall/Read` access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified SSH
    server using attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another
    method, capturing credentials stored in Jenkins. Additionally, the form
    validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF
    vulnerability. This vulnerability is also related to `CVE-2019-10472`

  title: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:libvirt-slave][1] is a Jenkins libvirt-slave
    plugin.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficiently
    Protected Credentials. A missing permission check in Jenkins Libvirt
    Slaves Plugin in form-related methods allowed users with `Overall/Read`
    access to enumerate credentials ID of credentials stored in Jenkins.
