    *Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState*, etc.\n\n*Deserialization of untrusted data*
    ([CWE-502][1]), is when the\napplication deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently
    verifying\nthat the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control\nthe
    state or the flow of the execution.\n\nJava deserialization issues have been known
    for years. However, interest\nin the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes
    that could be\nabused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular
    library\n(Apache Commons Collection)][2]. These classes were used in zero-days\naffecting
    IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.\n\nAn attacker just needs
    to identify a piece of software that has both a\nvulnerable class on its path,
    and performs deserialization on untrusted\ndata. Then all they need to do is send
    the payload into the\ndeserializer, getting the command executed.\n\n> Developers
    put too much trust in Java Object Serialization. Some even\n> de-serialize objects
    pre-authentication. When deserializing an Object\n> in Java you typically cast
    it to an expected type, and therefore\n> Java\\'s strict type system will ensure
    you only get valid object\n> trees. Unfortunately, by the time the type checking
    happens, platform\n> code has already created and executed significant logic.
    So, before\n> the final type is checked a lot of code is executed from the\n>
    readObject() methods of various objects, all of which is out of the\n> developer\\'s
    control. By combining the readObject() methods of various\n> classes which are
    available on the classpath of the vulnerable\n> application an attacker can execute
    functions (including calling\n> Runtime.exec() to execute local OS commands).\n>

    is one of the most pernicious vulnerabilities we’ve seen.\n> By merely existing
    on the Java classpath, seven “gadget” classes in\n> Apache Commons Collections

  description: 'It was found that the Apache commons-collections library permitted
    code execution when deserializing objects involving a specially constructed chain
    of classes. A remote attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary code with
    the permissions of the application using the commons-collections library.
