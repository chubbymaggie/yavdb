  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:rabbitmq-publisher][1] is a Jenkins plugin to
    connect RabbitMQ, then consume messages in queue.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass. A missing permission check in a form validation method of
    Rabbit-MQ Publisher Plugin allowed users with Overall/Read access to
    have Jenkins initiate a RabbitMQ connection to an attacker-specified
    host and port with an attacker-specified username and password.

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:rabbitmq-publisher][1] is a Jenkins plugin to
    connect RabbitMQ, then consume messages in queue.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The plugin stores the username and password in its
    configuration unencrypted in its global configuration file on the
    Jenkins master. This password could be viewed by users with access to
    the master file system.
