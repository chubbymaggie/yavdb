  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.apache.mina:mina-core][1] is a network application framework which
    helps users develop high performance and high scalability network
    applications easily.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. Handling of the `close_notify` SSL/TLS message does not lead
    to a connection closure, leading the server to retain the socket opened
    and to have the client potentially receive clear-text messages which
    were supposed to be encrypted.
