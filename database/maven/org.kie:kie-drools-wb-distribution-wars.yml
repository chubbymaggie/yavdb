  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [`org.kie:kie-drools-wb-distribution-wars`][1] Affected versions of the
    package are vulnerable to Authentication Bypass. The default
    authorization constrains in KIE Workbench 6.0.x allows remote
    authenticated users to read or write to arbitrary files, bypass intended
    access restrictions, and possibly have other unspecified impact via
    unknown vectors.
