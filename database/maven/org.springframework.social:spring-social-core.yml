  title: Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: "> It is possible for an attacker to gain access to a victim?s account
    using a CSRF-style attack against the Spring Social authentication feature. When
    a victim visits a specific URL that the attacker has crafted, the attackers social
    account will be tied to the victim?s website account. The attacker will then be
    able to use social authentication to log in to the victim?s account.\n> \n> --

  description: |
    [`org.springframework.social:spring-social-core`][1] It was found that
    when authorizing an application against an OAuth 2 API provider, Spring
    Social is vulnerable to a Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. The
    attack involves a malicious user beginning an OAuth 2 authorization flow
    using a fake account with an OAuth 2 API provider, but completing it by
    tricking the victim into visiting the callback request in their browser.
    As a consequence, the attacker will have access to the victim\'s account
    on the vulnerable site by way of the fake provider account.
