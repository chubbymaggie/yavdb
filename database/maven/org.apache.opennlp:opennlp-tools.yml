  title: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
  description: |
    [org.apache.opennlp:opennlp-tools][1] is a is a machine learning based
    toolkit for the processing of natural language text.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to XML External Entity
    (XXE) Injection. It is possible to perform an XXE attack when loading
    models or dictionaries from untrusted sources that contain XML.

    When loading models or dictionaries that contain XML it is possible to
    perform an XXE attack, since Apache OpenNLP is a library, this only
    affects applications that load models or dictionaries from untrusted
    sources. The versions 1.5.0 to 1.5.3, 1.6.0, 1.7.0 to 1.7.2, 1.8.0 to
    1.8.1 of Apache OpenNLP are affected.
