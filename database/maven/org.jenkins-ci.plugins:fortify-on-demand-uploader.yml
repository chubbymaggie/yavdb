  title: Server-side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:fortify-on-demand-uploader][1] is a plugin for
    the Fortify on Demand service. An API key from the FoD service is
    necessary for this plugin to communicate with FoD.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server-side Request
    Forgery (SSRF). An attacker with Overall/Read permission could initiate
    a connection to an attacker-specified server. The form validation
    methods now require `POST` requests and perform a permission check.
