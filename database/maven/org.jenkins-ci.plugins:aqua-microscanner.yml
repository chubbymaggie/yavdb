  title: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:aqua-microscanner][1] is a plugin that enables
    scanning of docker build for OS package vulnerabilities.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficiently
    Protected Credentials. The plugin stores credentials unencrypted in its
    global configuration file on the Jenkins master system. These
    credentials could be viewed by users with access to the master file
    system.

    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:aqua-microscanner][1] is a plugin that enables
    scanning of docker build for OS package vulnerabilities.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficiently
    Protected Credentials. Configured credentials used by the plugin were
    found to be transmitted in plain text as part of the global Jenkins
    configuration form, potentially resulting in their exposure.
