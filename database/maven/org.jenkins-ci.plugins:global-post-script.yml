  title: Insufficiently Protected Credentials
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:global-post-script][1] is a plugin to execute a
    global configured groovy/python script after each build of each job
    managed by the Jenkins.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficiently
    Protected Credentials. A missing permission check in Jenkins Global Post
    Script Plugin allows users with `Overall/Read` access to list the
    scripts available to the plugin stored on the Jenkins master file
    system.
