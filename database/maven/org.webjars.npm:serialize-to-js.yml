  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: "[org.webjars.npm:serialize-to-js][1] is a package to serialize objects\ninto
    a string while checking circular structures and respecting\nreferences.\n\nAffected
    versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service\n(DoS). It is possible
    for attackers to provide inputs that lead the\nexecution to loop indefinitely.\n\n###
    POC   {#poc}\n\n    const serializeToJs = require('serialize-to-js')\n    var
    str = 'function(){while(true){}}()'\n    var res = serializeToJs.deserialize(str)
    \n    console.log(res)\n\n\n\n[1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialize-to-js\n\\nDenial
    of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at\nmaking a system
    inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.\n\nUnlike other vulnerabilities,
    DoS attacks usually do not aim at\nbreaching security. Rather, they are focused
    on making websites and\nservices unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.\n\nOne
    popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed\nDenial of Service),
    an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the\nsystem by generating a large
    volume of traffic from many machines.\n\nWhen it comes to open source libraries,
    DoS vulnerabilities allow\nattackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the
    service by using a\nflaw either in the application code or from the use of open
    source\nlibraries.\n\nTwo common types of DoS vulnerabilities:\n\n* High CPU/Memory
    Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that\n  could cause the system
    to take a disproportionate amount of time to\n  process. For example,\n  [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).\n\n*
    Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the\n  system to
    crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)\n\n"
