  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [`http-signature`][1] is a reference implementation of Joyent\'s HTTP
    Signature scheme.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Timing Attacks due to
    time-variable comparison of signatures.

    The library implemented a character to character comparison, similar to
    the built-in string comparison mechanism, `===`, and not a time constant
    string comparison. As a result, the comparison will fail faster when the
    first characters in the signature are incorrect. An attacker can use
    this difference to perform a timing attack, essentially allowing them to
    guess the signature one character at a time.

    You can read more about timing attacks in Node.js on the [Snyk blog][2].
