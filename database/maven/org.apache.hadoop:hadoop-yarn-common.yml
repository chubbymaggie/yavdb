  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-yarn-common][1] is a distribution of Apache
    Hadoop with distributed metadata.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. When using Kerberos authentication, It allows remote cluster
    users to change the permissions of certain files to world-readable via a
    symlink attack in a public tar archive, which is not properly handled
    during localization, related to distributed cache.
