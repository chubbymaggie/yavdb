  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [hudson.plugins:project-inheritance][1] is a Project Inheritance Plugin

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). A missing permission check in the HTTP endpoint
    triggering project creation allows users with `Overall/Read` permission
    to create these projects. Additionally, the HTTP endpoint receiving
    these requests did not require POST requests, this can be used to
    conduct a CSRF attack.
