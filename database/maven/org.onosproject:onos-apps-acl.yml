  title: Time of Check Time of Use (TOCTOU)
  description: |
    [org.onosproject:onos-apps-acl][1] is a SDN controller platform that
    supports the transition from legacy “brown field” networks to SDN “green
    field” networks.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Time of Check Time
    of Use (TOCTOU). An attacker could bypass network access control via
    data plane packet injection.
