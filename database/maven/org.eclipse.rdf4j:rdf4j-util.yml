  title: Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip)
  description: "[org.eclipse.rdf4j:rdf4j-util][1] is the client code repository for
    the\nEclipse RDF4J project. It contains the main client-facing APIs and the\nvarious
    Rio parser and writer modules.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable
    to Arbitrary File Write\nvia Archive Extraction (Zip Slip). It allows Directory
    Traversal via ../\nin an entry in a ZIP archive.\n\n\n\n[1]: https://github.com/eclipse/rdf4j\n\\nIt
    is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path\ntraversal
    filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive\nis concatenated
    to the target extraction directory, which results in the\nfinal path ending up
    outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip\nmay hold a file with a \\\"../../file.exe\\\"
    location and thus break out of\nthe target folder. If an executable or a configuration
    file is\noverwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn\ninto
    an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example
    of a zip archive with one benign file and\none malicious file. Extracting the
    malicous file will result in\ntraversing out of the target folder, ending up in
    `/root/.ssh/`\noverwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n    \n    +2018-04-15
