  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.ovirt.engine.core:vdsbroker][1] is a complete virtualization
    management platform, licensed and developed as open source software.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The combination of `Enable Discard` and `Wipe After Delete`
    flags for VM disks, could cause a disk to be incompletely zeroed when
    removed from a VM. If the same storage blocks happen to be later
    allocated to a new disk attached to another VM, potentially sensitive
    data could be revealed to privileged users of that VM.
