    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:relution-publisher][1] is a Jenkins plugin for
    the Relution Enterprise Appstore.

    Protected Credentials. The plugin stores credentials unencrypted in its
    global configuration file on the Jenkins master where they can be viewed
    by users with access to the master file system.

  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:relution-publisher][1] is a Jenkins plugin for
    the Relution Enterprise Appstore.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). A missing permission check in a form validation method
    that does not require POST requests allows users with Overall/Read
    permission to initiate a connection test to an attacker-specified URL
    using attacker-specified credentials and attacker-specified HTTP proxy
    configuration.
