  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    Affected versions of [`org.scala-lang:scala-compiler`][1] are vulnerable
    to Arbitrary Code Execution.

    The compilation daemon in Scala before 2.10.7, 2.11.x before 2.11.12,
    and 2.12.x before 2.12.4 uses weak permissions for private files in
    /tmp/scala-devel/$\{USER:shared}/scalac-compile-server-port, which
    allows local users to write to arbitrary class files and consequently
    gain privileges.
