  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [`org.apache.cxf.fediz:fediz-jetty8`][1] is an open source services
    framework.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF).

    Apache CXF Fediz ships with a number of container-specific plugins to
    enable WS-Federation for applications. A CSRF (Cross Style Request
    Forgery) style vulnerability has been found in the Spring 2, Spring 3,
    Jetty 8 and Jetty 9 plugins in Apache CXF Fediz prior to 1.4.0, 1.3.2
    and 1.2.4. The attack relies on the client starting the authentication
    process, but not completing it (such as when the IdP is unavailable for
    example).

    *Note:* The Apache CXF and Tomcat plugins are not vulnerable to these
    attacks.
