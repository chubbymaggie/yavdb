  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [io.jenkins.docker:docker-plugin][1] is a plugin that allows slaves to
    be dynamically provisioned using Docker.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). The plugin does not perform permission checks on a
    method implementing form validation. This allows users with Overall/Read
    access to Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using
    attacker-specified credentials IDs obtained through another method,
    capturing credentials stored in Jenkins. Additionally, this form
    validation method did not require POST requests, resulting in a
    cross-site request forgery vulnerability.

  title: Missing Permission Check
  description: |
    [io.jenkins.docker:docker-plugin][1] is a plugin that allows slaves to
    be dynamically provisioned using Docker.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Missing Permission
    Check. A vulnerability in various `fillCredentialsIdItems` methods
    allowed users with Overall/Read access to enumerate credentials ID of
    credentials stored in Jenkins.
