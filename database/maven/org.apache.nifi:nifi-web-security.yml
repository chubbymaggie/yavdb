  title: Unauthorized Data Access
  description: |
    [`org.apache.nifi:nifi-web-security`][1] Affected versions of this
    package ate vulnerable to Unauthorized Data Access in a cluster
    environment. An anonymous user request can be replicated to another
    node. This node will contain the identity of the originating node rather
    than the anonymous user\'s identity.

  title: User Impersonation
  description: |
    [`org.apache.nifi:nifi-web-security`][1]

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to User Impersonation.
    An attacker could carefully craft a username to impersonate another user
    and gain their permissions on a replicated request to another node, via
    the the proxy chain serialization/deserialization functions as they are
    vulnerable to an injection attack. This only occurs in a cluster
    environment.

  title: Deserialization of Untrusted Data
  description: |
    [Apache NiFi][1] is a system to process and distribute data.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Deserialization of
    Untrusted Data.

    Any authenticated user (valid client certificate but without ACL
    permissions) could upload a template which contained malicious code and
    caused a denial of service via Java deserialization attack. The fix to
    properly handle Java deserialization was applied on the Apache NiFi
    1.4.0 release. Users running a prior 1.x release should upgrade to the
    appropriate release.

    \nSerialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of
    bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent
    through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of
    bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for
    communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence
    (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part
    of popular protocols like *Remote Method Invocation (RMI)*, *Java
    Management Extension (JMX)*, *Java Messaging System (JMS)*, *Action
    Message Format (AMF)*, *Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState*, etc.

    *Deserialization of untrusted data* ([CWE-502][1]), is when the
    application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying
    that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control
    the state or the flow of the execution.

    Java deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest
    in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be
    abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library
    (Apache Commons Collection)][2]. These classes were used in zero-days
    affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.

    An attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a
    vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted
    data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the
    deserializer, getting the command executed.
