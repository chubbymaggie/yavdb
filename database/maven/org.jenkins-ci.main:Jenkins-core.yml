  title: Insufficient Permission Validation
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.main:Jenkins-core][1] is an open-source automation
    server.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficient
    Permission Check for periodic processes. It allows users with read
    access to Jenkins to trigger background processes (that are otherwise
    performed daily) and may cause additional load on Jenkins master and
    agents.
