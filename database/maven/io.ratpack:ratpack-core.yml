  title: HTTP Response Splitting
  description: |
    [io.ratpack:ratpack-core][1] is a simple, capable, toolkit for creating
    high performance web applications.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Response
    Splitting. If untrusted and unsanitized data is used to populate the
    headers of an HTTP response, an attacker can utilize this vulnerability
    to have the server issue any HTTP response they specify. The root cause
    was due to using the `netty` `DefaultHttpHeaders object` with
    verification disabled.

    If your application uses arbitrary user input as the value of a response
    header it is vulnerable. If your application does not use arbitrary
    values as response header values, it is not vulnerable.
