    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:google-kubernetes-engine][1] is a plugin for
    deploying build artifacts to Kubernetes clusters running in GKE with
    Jenkins.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure
    due to a temporary file containing a temporary access token being
    created in the project workspace, where it could be accessed by users
    with Job/Read permission.
