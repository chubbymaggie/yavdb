    [`org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-mapreduce`][1] is a framework that allows for
    the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of
    computers using simple programming models.

    The Kerberos/MapReduce security functionality in Apache Hadoop
    0.20.203.0 through 0.20.205.0, 0.23.x before 0.23.2, and 1.0.x before
    1.0.2, as used in Cloudera CDH CDH3u0 through CDH3u2, Cloudera
    hadoop-0.20-sbin before 0.20.2+923.197, and other products, allows
    remote authenticated users to impersonate arbitrary cluster user
    accounts via unspecified vectors.

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-mapreduce][1] is a framework for job
    scheduling and cluster resource management.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. A cluster user may be able to expose private files owned by
    the user running the MapReduce job history server process. A malicious
    user can construct a configuration file containing XML directives that
    reference sensitive files on the MapReduce job history server host.
