  description: |
    [org.keycloak:keycloak-model-infinispan][1] is an Open Source Identity

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass. It did not correctly check permissions when handling service
    account user deletion requests sent to the rest server. An attacker with

    permissions and delete users in a separate realm.
