  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [org.apache.qpid:proton-j][1] is a messaging library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM) attacks. it included an optional wrapper layer to perform TLS,
    enabled by use of the `transport.ssl(...)` methods. Unless a
    verification mode was explicitly configured, client and server modes
    previously defaulted as documented to not verifying a peer certificate,
    with options to configure this explicitly or select a certificate
    verification mode with or without hostname verification being performed.
    The latter hostname verifying mode was not previously implemented, with
    attempts to use it resulting in an exception. This left only the option
    to verify the certificate is trusted, leaving such a client vulnerable
    to Man In The Middle (MITM) attack.
