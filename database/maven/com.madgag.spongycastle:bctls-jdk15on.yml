  title: TLS Padding Oracle
  description: |
    [`org.bouncycastle:bctls-jdk15on`][1]

    BouncyCastle TLS prior to version 1.0.3, when configured to use the JCE
    (Java Cryptography Extension) for cryptographic functions, provides a
    weak Bleichenbacher oracle when any TLS cipher suite using RSA key
    exchange is negotiated. An attacker can recover the private key from a
    vulnerable application. This vulnerability is referred to as ROBOT.
