  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [com.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-scalaApache][1] is an
    Add-on module for Jackson ([http://wiki.fasterxml.com/JacksonHome][2])
    to support Scala-specific datatypes.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM). The build files indicate that this project is resolving
    dependencies over HTTP instead of HTTPS. Any of these artifacts could
    have been MITM to maliciously compromise them and infect the build
    artifacts that were produced. Additionally, if any of these JARs or
    other dependencies were compromised, any developers using these could
    continue to be infected past updating to fix this.
