  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.apache.directory.api:api-ldap-client-api][1] provides directory
    solutions entirely written in Java.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The way the `SSL` Filter was setup made it possible for
    another thread to use the connection before the `TLS` layer has been
    established. If the connection has already been used and put back in a
    pool of connections, it would leak any information contained in this
    request.
