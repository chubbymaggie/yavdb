  title: Credential Exposure
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:build-publisher][1] is a Jenkins build-publisher
    plugin.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficiently
    Protected Credentials. It stores credentials to other Jenkins instances
    in the `hudson.plugins.build_publisher.BuildPublisher.xml` file in the
    Jenkins master home directory. These credentials were stored
    unencrypted, allowing anyone with local file system access to access
    them. Additionally, the credentials were also transmitted in plain text
    as part of the configuration form. This could result in exposure of the
    credentials through browser extensions, cross-site scripting
    vulnerabilities, and similar situations.
