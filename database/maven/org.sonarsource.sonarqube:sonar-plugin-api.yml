  title: Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip)
  description: "[org.sonarsource.sonarqube:sonar-plugin-api][1] provides the capability\nto
    not only show health of an application but also to highlight issues\nnewly introduced.\n\nAffected
    versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write\nvia Archive Extraction
    (AKA \\\"Zip Slip\\\").\n\nIt is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive,
    that holds path\ntraversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious
    archive\nis concatenated to the target extraction directory, which results in
    the\nfinal path ending up outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip\nmay
    hold a file with a \\\"../../file.exe\\\" location and thus break out of\nthe
    target folder. If an executable or a configuration file is\noverwritten with a
    file containing malicious code, the problem can turn\ninto an arbitrary code execution
    issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example of a zip archive with one benign
    file and\none malicious file. Extracting the malicous file will result in\ntraversing
    out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/`\noverwriting the `authorized_keys`

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.sonarsource.sonarqube:sonar-plugin-api][1] provides the capability
    to not only show health of an application but also to highlight issues
    newly introduced.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. An authenticated user could discover sensitive information
    such as valid user-account logins in the web application. The
    vulnerability occurs because of improperly configured access controls
    that cause the API to return the externalIdentity field to
    non-administrator users. The attacker could use this information in
    subsequent attacks against the system.
