  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [com.netflix.zuul:zuul-core][1] is a gateway service that provides
    dynamic routing, monitoring, resiliency, security, and more.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. If nodes become offline during the build, the `no_log`
    attribute of a task got ignored. In case the unreachable error occurred
    in a task used with a loop variable , the contents of the loop items
    would be printed in the console. This could lead to accidentally leaking
    credentials or secrets.
