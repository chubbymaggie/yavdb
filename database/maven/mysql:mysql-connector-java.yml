  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`mysql:mysql-connector-java`][1] provides connectivity for client
    applications developed in the Java programming language with MySQL
    Connector/J, a driver that implements the Java Database Connectivity
    (JDBC) API.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. Vulnerability in the MySQL Connectors component of Oracle
    MySQL (subcomponent: Connector/J). Supported versions that are affected
    are 5.1.41 and earlier. Easily \"exploitable\" vulnerability allows low
    privileged attacker with network access via multiple protocols to
    compromise MySQL Connectors. While the vulnerability is in MySQL
    Connectors, attacks may significantly impact additional products.
    Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized
    update, insert or delete access to some of MySQL Connectors accessible
    data as well as unauthorized read access to a subset of MySQL Connectors
    accessible data.
