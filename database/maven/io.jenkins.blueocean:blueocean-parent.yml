  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    \[io.jenkins.blueocean:blueocean-parent\]([https://github.com/jenkinsci/blueocean-plugin][1]
    is a reboot of the Jenkins CI/CD User Experience.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. It did not properly check the current user’s authentication and
    authorization when configuring existing GitHub organization folders.
    This allowed users with read access to the GitHub organization folder to
    reconfigure it, including changing the GitHub API endpoint for the
    organization folder to an attacker-controlled server to obtain the
    GitHub access token, if the organization folder was initially created
    using Blue Ocean.
