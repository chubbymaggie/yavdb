  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`org.fusesource.jansi:jansi`][1] is a small java library that allows
    you to use ANSI escape codes to format your console output which works
    even on windows.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. Race condition in
    hawtjni-runtime/src/main/java/org/fusesource/hawtjni/runtime/Library.java
    in HawtJNI before 1.8, when a custom library path is not specified,
    allows local users to execute arbitrary Java code by overwriting a
    temporary JAR file with a predictable name in /tmp

  title: 'HawtJNI: predictable temporary file name leading to local arbitrary code
    execution'
  description: '"The HawtJNI Library class wrote native libraries to a predictable
    file name  in /tmp when the native libraries were bundled in a JAR file, and no
    custom  library path was specified. A local attacker could overwrite these native  libraries
    with malicious versions during the window between when HawtJNI  writes them, and
    when they are executed."
