  title: Signature Validation Bypass
  description: |
    [com.inversoft:prime-jwt][1] is a simple to use Java 8 JWT Library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Signature Validation
    Bypass. It contains an input validation vulnerability in
    `JWTDecoder.decode` that can result in a JWT that is decoded and thus
    implicitly validated even if it lacks a valid signature. This attack
    appears to be exploitable via an attacker crafting a token with a valid
    header and body and then requests it to be validated.
