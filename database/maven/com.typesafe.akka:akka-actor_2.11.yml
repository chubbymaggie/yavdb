  title: Insecure Random Number Generation
  description: |
    [com.typesafe.akka:akka-actor\_2.11][1] is a toolkit for building highly
    concurrent, distributed, and resilient message-driven applications for
    Java and Scala.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Random
    Number Generation. When a custom random number generator is configured,
    if the `AES128CounterSecureRNG` and `AES256CounterSecureRNG` are
    enabled, a malicious user could easily guess the random number used
    during encryption and possibly eavesdrop onto ongoing communications.
    This is due a bug in the `AES128CounterSecureRNG` and
    `AES256CounterSecureRNG` implementations, causing the generated numbers
    to repeat themselves after a few bytes.
