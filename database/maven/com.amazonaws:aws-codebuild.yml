  title: Credentials Disclosure
  description: |
    [com.amazonaws:aws-codebuild][1] provides a build step for the Jenkins
    project.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Credentials
    Disclosure. It stored the `AWS` Secret Key in its configuration
    unencrypted in job\'s `config.xml` files on the Jenkins master. This key
    could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the
    master file system. While masked from view using a password form field,
    the `AWS` Secret Key was transferred in plain text to users when
    accessing the job configuration form.
