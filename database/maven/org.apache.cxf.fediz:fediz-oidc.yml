  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [`org.apache.cxf.fediz:fediz-oidc`][1] is an open source services
    framework.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF).

    Apache CXF Fediz ships with an OpenId Connect (OIDC) service which has a
    Client Registration Service, which is a simple web application that
    allows clients to be created, deleted, etc. A CSRF (Cross Style Request
    Forgery) style vulnerability has been found in this web application in
    Apache CXF Fediz prior to 1.4.0 and 1.3.2, meaning that a malicious web
    application could create new clients, or reset secrets, etc, after the
    admin user has logged on to the client registration service and the
    session is still active.
