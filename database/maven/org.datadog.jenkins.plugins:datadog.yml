  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.datadog.jenkins.plugins:datadog][1] is a Jenkins plugin used to
    forward metrics, events, and service checks to an account at Datadog,
    automatically.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The Datadog Plugin stores an API key to access the Datadog
    service in the global Jenkins configuration. While the API key is stored
    encrypted on disk, it was transmitted in plain text as part of the
    configuration form. This could result in exposure of the API key through
    browser extensions, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities, and similar
    situations.
