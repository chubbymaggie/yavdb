  title: Sandbox Bypassing
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:ontrack][1] allows Jenkins to notify ontrack
    about events like build creation, status of running job, etc. but also
    allows Jenkins to require information from ontrack.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Sandbox Bypassing.
    An attacker with control over ontrack DSL definitions is allowed to
    execute arbitrary code on the Jenkins master JVM.

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:ontrack][1] is a plugin that allows Jenkins to
    notify ontrack about events like build creation, status of running job,
    etc. but also allows Jenkins to require information from ontrack.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. Sandbox protection cab be circumvented during parsing,
    compilation, and script instantiation by providing a crafted Groovy
    script. This allowed users able to control the pluginâ€™s job-specific
    configuration to bypass the sandbox protection and execute arbitrary
    code on the Jenkins master.
