  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`org.apache.camel:camel-snakeyaml`][1] is a versatile open-source
    integration framework based on known Enterprise Integration Patterns.

    Apache Camel\'s `camel-snakeyaml` is vulnerable to arbitrary code
    execution. User input is sent to object de-serialization, allowing
    attackers to craft malicious calls containing java code that will run on
    the server.
