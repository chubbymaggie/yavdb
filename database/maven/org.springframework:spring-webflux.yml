  title: Multipart Content Pollution
  description: |
    [org.springframework:spring-webflux][1] Spring provides everything you
    need beyond the Java language to create enterprise applications in a
    wide range of scenarios and architectures.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Multipart Content
    Pollution. It provides client-side support for multipart requests. When
    the server application (server A) receives input from a remote client,
    and then uses that input to make a multipart request to another server
    (server B), it can be exposed to an attack, where an extra multipart is
    inserted in the content of the request from server A, causing server B
    to use the wrong value for a part it expects. This could to lead
    privilege escalation, for example, if the part content represents a
    username or user roles.
