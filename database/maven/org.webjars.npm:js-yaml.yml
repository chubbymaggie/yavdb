  title: "[CVE-2013-4660]  Improper Input Validation"
  description: The JS-YAML module before 2.0.5 for Node.js parses input without properly
    considering the unsafe !!js/function tag, which allows remote attackers to execute
    arbitrary code via a crafted string that triggers an eval operation.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [org.webjars.npm:js-yaml][1] is a human-friendly data serialization
    language.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). The parsing of a specially crafted YAML file may exhaust the
    system resources.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [org.webjars.npm:js-yaml][1] is a human-friendly data serialization
    language.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. When an object with an executable `toString()` property used
    as a map key, it will execute that function. This happens only for
    `load()`, which should not be used with untrusted data anyway.
    `safeLoad()` is not affected because it can\'t parse functions.
