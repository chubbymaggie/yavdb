  title: Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip)
  description: "[org.apache.storm:storm-core][1] is a distributed realtime computation\nsystem.\n\nAffected
    versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write\nvia Archive Extraction
    (Zip Slip).\n\n\n\n[1]: http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.storm/storm-core\n\\nIt
    is exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path\ntraversal
    filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive\nis concatenated
    to the target extraction directory, which results in the\nfinal path ending up
    outside of the target folder. For instance, a zip\nmay hold a file with a \\\"../../file.exe\\\"
    location and thus break out of\nthe target folder. If an executable or a configuration
    file is\noverwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn\ninto
    an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example
    of a zip archive with one benign file and\none malicious file. Extracting the
    malicous file will result in\ntraversing out of the target folder, ending up in
    `/root/.ssh/`\noverwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n    \n    +2018-04-15

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [org.apache.storm:storm-core][1] is a distributed realtime computation
    system.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. An attacker with access to a secure storm cluster in some
    cases could execute arbitrary code as a different user.
