  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:zephyr-enterprise-test-management][1] is a
    Zephyr Enterprise Test Management connector for Jenkins.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). A missing permission check in a form validation method
    in Zephyr Enterprise Test Management Plugin allows users with
    Overall/Read permission to initiate a connection test to an
    attacker-specified server with attacker-specified credentials. The form
    validation method does not require POST requests, resulting in a CSRF
    vulnerability.
