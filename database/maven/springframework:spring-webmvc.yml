  title: "[CVE-2016-5007]  Permissions, Privileges, and Access Controls"
  description: Both Spring Security 3.2.x, 4.0.x, 4.1.0 and the Spring Framework 3.2.x,
    4.0.x, 4.1.x, 4.2.x rely on URL pattern mappings for authorization and for mapping
    requests to controllers respectively. Differences in the strictness of the pattern
    matching mechanisms, for example with regards to space trimming in path segments,
    can lead Spring Security to not recognize certain paths as not protected that
    are in fact mapped to Spring MVC controllers that should be protected. The problem
    is compounded by the fact that the Spring Framework provides richer features with
    regards to pattern matching as well as by the fact that pattern matching in each
    Spring Security and the Spring Framework can easily be customized creating additional
    differences.

  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [`springframework:spring-webmvc`][1] It was found that differences in
    the strictness of Spring Security, and Spring Framework request mapping
    could lead to resources not being secured. An attacker could use this
    flaw to bypass authentication.
