  title: "[CVE-2014-3527]  Improper Authentication"
  description: When using the CAS Proxy ticket authentication from Spring Security
    3.1 to 3.2.4 a malicious CAS Service could trick another CAS Service into authenticating
    a proxy ticket that was not associated. This is due to the fact that the proxy
    ticket authentication uses the information from the HttpServletRequest which is
    populated based upon untrusted information within the HTTP request. This means
    if there are access control restrictions on which CAS services can authenticate
    to one another, those restrictions can be bypassed. If users are not using CAS
    Proxy tickets and not basing access control decisions based upon the CAS Service,
    then there is no impact to users.

  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [`org.springframework.security:spring-security-cas`][1] When using
    Spring Security\'s CAS Proxy ticket authentication, a malicious CAS
    Service could trick another CAS Service into authenticating a proxy
    ticket that was not associated. A remote attacker could use this flaw to
    bypass any access control restrictions on which CAS services can
    authenticate to one another.
