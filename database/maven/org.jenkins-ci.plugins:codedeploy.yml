  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:codedeploy][1] provides a post-build step for
    the Jenkins project.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information Exposure
    via the `AWSCodeDeployPublisher.jave` method. It could persist
    environment variables from the last run of any project with the
    post-build step configured in the job’s `config.xml` file. In some
    cases, this allowed users with file system access or Extended Read
    permission to obtain those potentially sensitive environment variables
    by accessing the project’s `config.xml`.

  title: Credentials Disclosure
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:codedeploy][1] provides a post-build step for
    the Jenkins project.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Credentials
    Disclosure via the `AWSCodeDeployPublisher.java` method. It stored the
    AWS Secret Key in its configuration unencrypted in job\'s `config.xml`
    files and its global configuration file on the Jenkins master. This key
    could be viewed by users with Extended Read permission, or access to the
    master file system. While masked from view using a password form field,
    the AWS Secret Key was transferred in plain text to users when accessing
    the job configuration form.
