  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: |+
    [org.apache.james.hupa:hupa-server][1] is a Rich IMAP-based Webmail
    application written in GWT.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS) attacks via the message list and view in the Hupa Webmail
    application. An attacker could send a carefully crafted email to a user
    of Hupa which would trigger a XSS when the email was opened or when a
    list of messages were viewed.
