    [`org.apache.directory.studio:org.apache.directory.studio.ldapbrowser.core`][1]
    The CSV export in Apache LDAP Studio and Apache Directory Studio before
    2.0.0-M10 does not properly escape field values, which might allow
    attackers to execute arbitrary commands by leveraging a crafted LDAP
    entry that is interpreted as a formula when imported into a spreadsheet.
