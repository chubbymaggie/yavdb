  title: Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: "> It is possible for an attacker to gain access to a victim?s account
    using a CSRF-style attack against the Spring Social authentication feature. When
    a victim visits a specific URL that the attacker has crafted, the attackers social
    account will be tied to the victim?s website account. The attacker will then be
    able to use social authentication to log in to the victim?s account.\n> \n> --
