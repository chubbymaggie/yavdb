  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:git-client][1] is extracted from git-plugin to
    make it easier for other plugins to use and contribute new features.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. Temporary files were previously written to the Java temporary
    directory with default permissions. A malicious actor with local file
    access could have captured sensitive information by reading files from
    that directory.

  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:git-client][1] is a Jenkins git client plugin.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). The plugin did not properly restrict values passed as
    URL argument to an invocation of `git ls-remote`, resulting in OS
    command injection.
