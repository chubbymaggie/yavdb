  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:git-client][1] is extracted from git-plugin to
    make it easier for other plugins to use and contribute new features.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. Temporary files were previously written to the Java temporary
    directory with default permissions. A malicious actor with local file
    access could have captured sensitive information by reading files from
    that directory.
