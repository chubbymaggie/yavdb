  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [org.apache.kafka:kafka-streams][1] is a streaming platform that can
    publish and subscribe to streams of records, store streams of records in
    a fault-tolerant durable way, and process streams of records as they
    occur.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). A bug in the InternalTopicManager makes it seems like a topic
    exists even though it doesn\'t, after a topic is marked for deletion and
    before it is actually deleted.

    In that timespan, the Broker gives inconsistent information while it
    starts polling for metadata. The consequence is that the client goes
    into a loop where it polls for topic metadata and because this is done
    by many small threads - it can take down a small cluster or degrade
    greatly its performances.

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
