  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [org.apache.cloudstack:cloudstack][1] is an open source software
    designed to deploy and manage large networks of virtual machines.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. An attacker may determine the ID of another (non-root)
    CloudStack user, reset the API keys for the other user, in turn
    accessing their account and resources.
