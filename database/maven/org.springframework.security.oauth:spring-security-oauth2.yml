    [`org.springframework.security.oauth:spring-security-oauth2`][1]
    provides support for using Spring Security with OAuth (1a) and OAuth2.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. A malicious user or attacker can craft an authorization
    request to the authorization endpoint that can lead to a remote code
    execution when the resource owner is forwarded to the approval endpoint.

    [`org.springframework.security.oauth:spring-security-oauth2`][1]
    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution. When processing authorization requests using the whitelabel
    views, the response\_type parameter value was executed as Spring SpEL
    which enabled a malicious user to trigger remote code execution via the
    crafting of the value for response\_type.
