  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`org.apache.tomcat:tomcat-catalina-jmx-remote`][1] Affected versions of
    the package are vulnerable to Remote Code Execution. The
    `JmxRemoteLifecycleListener` was not updated to take account of
    Oracle\'s fix for CVE-2016-3427. Therefore, Tomcat installations using
    this listener remained vulnerable to a similar remote code execution
    vulnerability. This issue has been rated as important rather than
    critical due to the small number of installations using this listener
    and that it would be highly unusual for the JMX ports to be accessible
    to an attacker even when the listener is used.
