  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [`org.neo4j:neo4j-security`][1] is the world’s leading Graph Database.
    It is a high performance graph store with all the features expected of a
    mature and robust database, like a friendly query language and ACID
    transactions.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Timing Attack due to
    using the `Arrays.equals` to validate the password, which is vulnerable
    to a brute force attacks by malicious users.
