  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [`org.mortbay.jasper:apache-jsp`][1] The Expression Language (EL)
    implementation in Apache Tomcat 6.x before 6.0.44, 7.x before 7.0.58,
    and 8.x before 8.0.16 does not properly consider the possibility of an
    accessible interface implemented by an inaccessible class, which allows
    attackers to bypass a SecurityManager protection mechanism via a web
    application that leverages use of incorrect privileges during EL
    evaluation.
