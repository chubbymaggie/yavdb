  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-yaml-provider`][1] Affected versions of
    the package are vulnerable to remote code execution. It was discovered
    that under certain conditions RESTEasy could be forced to parse a
    request with YamlProvider, resulting in unmarshalling of potentially
    untrusted data. An attacker could possibly use this flaw execute
    arbitrary code with the permissions of the application using RESTEasy.

    Serialization is a process of converting an object into a sequence of
    bytes which can be persisted to a disk or database or can be sent
    through streams. The reverse process of creating object from sequence of
    bytes is called deserialization. Serialization is commonly used for
    communication (sharing objects between multiple hosts) and persistence
    (store the object state in a file or a database). It is an integral part
    of popular protocols like *Remote Method Invocation (RMI)*, *Java
    Management Extension (JMX)*, *Java Messaging System (JMS)*, *Action
    Message Format (AMF)*, *Java Server Faces (JSF) ViewState*, etc.

    *Deserialization of untrusted data* ([CWE-502][2]), is when the
    application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying
    that the resulting data will be valid, letting the attacker to control
    the state or the flow of the execution.

    Java deserialization issues have been known for years. However, interest
    in the issue intensified greatly in 2015, when classes that could be
    abused to achieve remote code execution were found in a [popular library
    (Apache Commons Collection)][3]. These classes were used in zero-days
    affecting IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic and many other products.

    An attacker just needs to identify a piece of software that has both a
    vulnerable class on its path, and performs deserialization on untrusted
    data. Then all they need to do is send the payload into the
    deserializer, getting the command executed.

    [org.jboss.resteasy:resteasy-yaml-provider][1] is a JBoss project that
    provides various frameworks to help you build RESTful Web Services and
    RESTful Java applications.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution due to using the insecure `Yaml.load()` function in the
    YamlProvider.

    RESTEasy could be forced to parse a request with YamlProvider, resulting
    in unmarshalling of potentially untrusted data. An attacker could
    possibly use this flaw execute arbitrary code with the permissions of
    the application using RESTEasy.
