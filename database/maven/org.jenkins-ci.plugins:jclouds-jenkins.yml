  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [org.jenkins-ci.plugins:jclouds-jenkins][1] is a plugin that uses
    JClouds to provide slave launching on most of the currently usable Cloud
    infrastructures.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). The plugin does not perform permission checks on a
    method implementing form validation. This form validation method did not
    require POST requests. This allows users with `Overall/Read access` to
    Jenkins to connect to an attacker-specified URL using attacker-specified
    credentials IDs obtained through another method, capturing credentials
    stored in Jenkins.
