  title: Insecure Randomness
  description: |
    [io.ratpack:ratpack-session][1] is a that allows supports for HTTP
    sessions within Ratpack applications.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Randomness.
    Session IDs are generated using a weak PRNG within the
    `ThreadLocalRandom` class. An attacker could abuse this vulnerability to
    determine a small window for the server start time and obtain a session
    ID value. This vulnerability could be abused to theoretically determine
    the sequence of session IDs.
