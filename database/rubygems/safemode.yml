  title: Safemode Gem for Ruby is vulnerable to information disclosure
  description: |
    Safemode is initialised with an optional 'delegate' object.
    If the delegated object is a Rails controller, 'inspect' could
    be called which then exposes all informations about the App,
    including routes, secret tokens, caches and so on.

  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [safemode][1] is a library for safe evaluation of Ruby code based on
    RubyParser and Ruby2Ruby.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to bypassing safe mode
    limitations via special Ruby syntax. This can lead to deletion of
    objects for which the user does not have delete permissions or possibly
    to privilege escalation.
