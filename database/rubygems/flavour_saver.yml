  title: 'FlavourSaver handlebars helper remote code execution.

'
  description: |
    FlavourSaver contains a flaw in helper method dispatch where it uses
    Kernel::send to call helpers without checking that they are defined
    within the template context first.  This allows expressions such as
    {{system "ls"}} or {{eval "puts 1 + 1"}} to be executed.

  title: Arbitrary Command Execution
  description: |
    [`FlavourSaver`][1] is a pure-ruby implementation of the Handlebars
    templating language. Affected versions of this gem are vulnerable to
    arbitrary command execution via the helper method dispatch where it uses
    `Kernel::send` to call helpers without checking that they are defined
    within the template context first. This allows expressions such as
    `{{system "ls"}}` or `{{eval "puts 1 + 1"}}` to be executed.
