  title: Vulnerability in aescrypt because IV is not randomized
  description: |
    The aescrypt gem 1.0.0 for Ruby does not randomize the CBC IV for use with the
    AESCrypt.encrypt and AESCrypt.decrypt functions, which allows attackers to
    defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms via a chosen plaintext attack.

  title: Chosen Cyphertext Attack
  description: |
    [`aescrypt`][1] is Simple AES encryption / decryption for Ruby. Affected
    versions of the package are vulnerable to Chosen Cyphertext Attack. Is
    uses an unauthenticated encryption mode (CBC) which is vulnerable to
    chosen ciphertext attacks, allowing active attackers to completely
    recover message plaintexts. It also allows attackers to make
    undetectable alterations to the plaintext.

  title: Insecure Encryption
  description: |
    [`aescrypt`][1] is a simple AES encryption / decryption for Ruby.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Insecure Encryption
    because it does not randomize the `CBC IV` for use with the
    `AESCrypt.encrypt` and `AESCrypt.decrypt` functions, which allows
    attackers to defeat cryptographic protection mechanisms via a chosen
    plaintext attack.
