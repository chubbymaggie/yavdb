    and bytes_wav methods in the lib/espeak/speech.rb library.

  title: Arbitrary Command Injection
  description: |
    [`espeak-ruby`][1] is a small Ruby API for utilizing ‘espeak’ and ‘lame’
    to create Text-To-Speech mp3 files. Affected versions of the package are
    vulnerable to Arbitrary Command Injection and Environment variable
    disclosure. User input is passed as an argument in the `speak`, `save`,
    `bytes` or `bytes_wav` methods in `lib/espeak/speech.rb`, allowing a
    malicious user to run arbitrary code or see environment variables.
