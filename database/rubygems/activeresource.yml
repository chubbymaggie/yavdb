  title: activeresource Gem for Ruby lib/active_resource/connection.rb request Function
    Multiple Variable Format String
  description: |
    activeresource contains a format string flaw in the request function of
    lib/active_resource/connection.rb. The issue is triggered as format string
    specifiers (e.g. %s and %x) are not properly sanitized in user-supplied input
    when passed via the 'result.code' and 'result.message' variables. This may
    allow a remote attacker to cause a denial of service or potentially execute
    arbitrary code.
