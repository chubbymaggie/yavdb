  title: Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
  description: |
    [ruby-openid][1] is a library for consuming and serving OpenID
    identities.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Server Side Request
    Forgery (SSRF) via the Yadis consumer discovery functionality provided
    by the gem. A lack of verification can lead to a forged assertion
    request being manipulated to the value of the `claimed_id` URL parameter
    which can be exploited with SSRF attacks. Developers who based their
    OpenID integration heavily on the \"example app\" provided by the
    project are at highest risk.

    For application developers, mitigations for affected apps exist:

    * Disable Yadis discovery if not needed
    * If Yadis discovery is required, or cannot be disabled, add your own
      strict checks against the value of the claimed\_id URL parameter at
      the very beginning of OpenID 2.0 assertion processing
