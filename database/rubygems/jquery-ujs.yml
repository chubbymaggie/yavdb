  title: CSRF Vulnerability in jquery-ujs
  description: |
    In the scenario where an attacker might be able to control the href attribute
    of an anchor tag or the action attribute of a form tag that will trigger a
    POST action, the attacker can set the href or action to
    " https://attacker.com" (note the leading space) that will be passed to
    JQuery, who will see this as a same origin request, and send the user's CSRF
    token to the attacker domain.

    To work around this problem, change code that allows users to control the
    href attribute of an anchor tag or the action attribute of a form tag to
    filter the user parameters.

    For example, code like this:

      link_to params

    to code like this:

      link_to filtered_params

      def filtered_params
        \# Filter just the parameters that you trust
      end

  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [`jquery-ujs`][1] is a Ruby on Rails unobtrusive scripting adapter for
    jQuery.

    Affected versions allow a CSRF attack with a maliciously crafted anchor
    element. In the scenario where an attacker might be able to control the
    href attribute of an anchor tag or the action attribute of a form tag
    that will trigger a POST action, the attacker can set the href or action
    to \" [https://attacker.com\"][2] (note the leading space). This will be
    passed to JQuery, and be treated as a same origin request, potentially
    send the user\'s CSRF token to the attacker domain.
