  title: RedCloth Gem for Ruby Textile Link Parsing XSS
  description: |
    RedCloth Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that allows a cross-site scripting (XSS)
    attack. This flaw exists because the program does not validate input when
    parsing textile links before returning it to users. This may allow a remote
    attacker to create a specially crafted request that would execute arbitrary
    script code in a user's browser session within the trust relationship between
    their browser and the server.
