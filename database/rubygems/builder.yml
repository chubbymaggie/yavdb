  title: Builder Gem for Ruby Tag Name Handling Private Method Exposure
  description: |
    Builder Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in the handling of tag names. The issue
    is triggered when the program reads tag names from XML data and then calls a
    method with that name. With a specially crafted file, a context-dependent
    attacker can call private methods and manipulate data.

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [`builder`][1] provides a number of builder objects that make creating
    structured data simple to do. Affected version of this gem mishandles
    reading tag names from XML data and then calls a method with the same
    name. With a specially crafted file, a context-dependent attacker can
    call private methods and manipulate data.
