  title: Incorrect Access Control
  description: |
    [simple\_form][1] is a Forms made easy gem for Rails with simple DSL.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Incorrect Access
    Control. For pages that build a form using user input, it is possible
    for an attacker to manipulate the input and send any method present in
    the form object. This is due to the `file_method?` in
    `lib/simple_form/form_builder.rb` treating a user-supplied string as a
    method call. The vulnerability is only applicable for pages that build
    forms based on user input.

    ### PoC   {#poc}

        <%= simple_form_for @user do |f| %>
          <%= f.label @user_supplied_string %>
          ...
        <% end %>
