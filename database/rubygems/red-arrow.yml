  title: Use of Uninitialized Variable
  description: |
    [red-arrow][1] is a base Apache Arrow bindings

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Use of Uninitialized
    Variable. It was discovered that the C++ implementation (which underlies
    the R, Python and Ruby implementations) of Apache Arrow has an
    uninitialized memory bug when building arrays with null values in some
    cases. This can lead to uninitialized memory being unintentionally
    shared if Arrow Arrays are transmitted over the wire (for instance with
    Flight) or persisted in the streaming IPC and file formats.
