  title: Improper minification of non-boolean comparisons
  description: |
    [`uglifier`][1] is a gem that minifies and compresses JavaScript files.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper
    minification of non-boolean comparisons. It slightly alters the
    functionality of a JavaScript file after the minification process. This
    bug was demonstrated to allow potentially malicious code to be hidden
    within secure code, and activated by the minification process.
    \"[Backdooring your JavaScript using minifier bugs][2]\" explains how
    this works.
