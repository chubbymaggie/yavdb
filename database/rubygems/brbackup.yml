  title: brbackup Gem for Ruby /lib/brbackup.rb name Parameter SQL Injection
  description: |
    brbackup Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that may allow carrying out an SQL
    injection attack. The issue is due to the /lib/brbackup.rb script not
    properly sanitizing user-supplied input to the 'name' parameter. This may
    allow a remote attacker to inject or manipulate SQL queries in the back-end
    database, allowing for the manipulation or disclosure of arbitrary data.
