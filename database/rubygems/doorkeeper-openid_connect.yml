  title: Open Redirect
  description: |
    [doorkeeper-openid\_connect][1] is an OpenID Connect extension for
    Doorkeeper.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect via
    the `redirect_uri` field in an OAuth authorization request (that results
    in an error response) with the `openid` scope and a `prompt=none` value.
    This allows for phishing attacks against the authorization flow.
