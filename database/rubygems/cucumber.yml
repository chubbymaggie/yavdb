  title: HTML Injection
  description: |
    [`cucumber`][1] is behavior Driven Development with elegance and joy.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to HTML Injection. The
    HTML formatter appends any scenario output to the HTML without escaping
    HTML tags in the messages. This way, any output from the steps gets
    injected into the report page. In the simple case, this won\'t display
    the message as expected. When combined with for example capybara and CI
    environments this opens up the possibility of an XSS attack from the
    user input on the environment being tested.
