  title: Improper Input Validation
  description: |
    [thin][1] is a thin and fast web server.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Input
    Validation. `lib/thin/connection.rb` relies on the `X-Forwarded-For`
    header to determine the IP address of the client, which allows remote
    attackers to spoof the IP address and hide activities via a modified
    `X-Forwarded-For` header.
