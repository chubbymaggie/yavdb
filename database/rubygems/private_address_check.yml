  title: private_address_check Ruby Gem Resolv.getaddresses Server-Side Request Forgery
  description: |
    The private_address_check ruby gem before 0.4.0 is vulnerable to a bypass due to use of Ruby's
    Resolv.getaddresses method, which is OS-dependent and should not be relied upon for security
    measures, such as when used to blacklist private network addresses to prevent server-side
    request forgery.

    The private_address_check ruby gem before 0.4.1 is vulnerable to a bypass due to an incomplete

  description: |
    private_address_check ruby gem before 0.5.0 is vulnerable to a time-of-check time-of-use (TOCTOU)
    race condition due to the address the socket uses not being checked. DNS entries with a TTL of 0
    can trigger this case where the initial resolution is a public address by the subsequent
    resolution is a private address.
