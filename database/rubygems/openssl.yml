  title: Incorrect handling of initialization vector in the GCM mode in OpenSSL
  description: |
    The openssl gem for Ruby uses the same initialization vector (IV) in
    GCM Mode (aes-*-gcm) when the IV is set before the key, which makes it easier for
    context-dependent attackers to bypass the encryption protection mechanism.

  title: Insecure Initialization Vector
  description: |
    [openssl][1] is a package that wraps the OpenSSL library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure
    Initialization Vector. The openssl gem for Ruby uses the same
    initialization vector (IV) in GCM Mode `(aes-*-gcm)` when the IV is set
    before the key, which makes it easier for context-dependent attackers to
    bypass the encryption protection mechanism.
