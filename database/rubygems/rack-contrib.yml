  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [`rack-contrib`][1] includes a variety of add-on components for Rack, a
    Ruby web server interface.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF) attacks due to not properly restricting the SWF file
    format. An attacker can use JSONP callbacks to cause a trusted domain to
    return a specially crafted malicious SWF file, which can make requests
    to the trusted domain with the victims credentials. **Note:** Related to
    CVE-2014-4671.

    You can read more about `Cross-site Scripting (XSS)` on our [blog][2].
