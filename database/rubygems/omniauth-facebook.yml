  description: |
    omniauth-facebook Gem for Ruby contains a flaw as HTTP requests do not
    require multiple steps, explicit confirmation, or a unique token when
    performing certain sensitive actions. By tricking a user into following
    a specially crafted link, a context-dependent attacker can perform a
    Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF / XSRF) attack causing the victim to
    perform an unspecified action.
