    [`dragonfly`][1] is a framework that enables on-the-fly processing for
    any content type. This gem was renamed from `fog-dragonfly` to
    `dragonfly`.

    Affected versions of this gem are vulnerable to a remote attacker
    gaining read/write access to the filesystem, and executing arbitrary
    commands via a flaw in uploading &amp; processing. This is that is due
    to the gem failing to restrict arbitrary commands to imagemagicks
    convert.
