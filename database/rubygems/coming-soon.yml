  title: Malicious Package
  description: |
    [coming-soon][1] is a gem that provides details of movies that are
    coming soon.

    The package included a code-execution backdoor inserted by a third
    party. No unaffected version is known to exist, as the gem appears to
    have been entirely removed.
