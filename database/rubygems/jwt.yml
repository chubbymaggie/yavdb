  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [`jwt`][1] is a pure ruby implementation of the RFC 7519 OAuth JSON Web
    Token (JWT) standard.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Timing Attacks due to
    time-variable comparison of signatures. A malicious user can guess a
    valid signature one char at a time by considering the time it takes a
    signature validation to fail.

    For more information on Timing Attacks, see our [blog][2]
