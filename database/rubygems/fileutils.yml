  title: fileutils Gem for Ruby /lib/file_utils/open_office.rb Character Handling
    Remote Command Execution
  description: fileutils Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in /lib/file_utils/open_office.rb.
    The issue is triggered when handling a specially crafted URL containing a command
    after a delimiter (;). This may allow a remote attacker to potentially execute
    arbitrary commands.

  title: Symlink File Overwrite
  description: |
    [`fileutils`][1] is a set of utility classes to extract meta data from
    different file types. Affected versions of this gem are vulnerable to
    arbitrary file overwrite. It is possible for a local attacker to use a
    symlink attack against temporary files created by `files_utils.rb` to
    cause the program to unexpectedly overwrite an arbitrary file.

  title: Directory Hijacking
  description: |
    [`fileutils`][1] is a set of utility classes to extract meta data from
    different file types. Affected versions of this gem are vulnerable to
    directory hijacking, due to the program not verifying the existence of a
    directory before attempting to create it. This may allow a local
    attacker to create the directory in advance, thus owning any files
    subsequently written to it.

  title: Arbitrary Command Execution
  description: |
    [`fileutils`][1] is a set of utility classes to extract meta data from
    different file types. Affected versions of this gem are vulnerable to
    arbitrary command execution via a specially crafted URL containing a
    command after a delimiter (;). This allows a remote attacker to
    potentially execute arbitrary commands. The flaw is in the
    `/lib/file_utils/open_office.rb` script.
