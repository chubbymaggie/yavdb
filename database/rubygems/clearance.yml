  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [`clearance`][1] is an authentication app for rails.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Timing Attack. When
    attempting to authenticate a user, but no user was found with the
    provided email address, it skips calls to`BCrypt`. This allows attackers
    to time the response from the app to see if the provided user has an
    account, and help when attempting to guess a users password.
