  title: sprout Gem for Ruby archive_unpacker.rb unpack_zip() Function Multiple Parameter
    Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    sprout Gem for Ruby contains a flaw in the unpack_zip() function in
    archive_unpacker.rb. The issue is due to the program failing to properly
    sanitize input passed via the 'zip_file', 'dir', 'zip_name', and 'output'
    parameters. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to execute arbitrary
    code.

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [sprout][1] is a modular set of tools that take the tedium and
    frustration out of creating and managing programming projects by
    automatically installing and configuring external tools, libraries,
    commands and build tasks. Affected versions of this gem are vulnerable
    to arbitrary code execution due to a flaw in the `unpack_zip()` function
    in `archive_unpacker.rb`. The program fails to properly sanitize input
    passed via the `zip_file`, `dir`, `zip_name`, and `output` parameters
    which may allow a context-dependent attacker to execute arbitrary code.
