  title: Oracle "enhanced" ActiveRecord Gem for Ruby :limit / :offset SQL Injection
  description: |
    Oracle "enhanced" ActiveRecord Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that may allow an
    attacker to carry out an SQL injection attack. The issue is due to the
    program not properly sanitizing user-supplied input related to the :limit and
    :offset functions. This may allow an attacker to inject or manipulate SQL
    queries in the back-end database, allowing for the manipulation or disclosure
    of arbitrary data.
