  title: Symlink File Overwrite
  description: |
    [VladTheEnterprising][1] is a series of packages to help using the
    `Vlad` gem to manage \"enterprise\" environments. Affected versions of
    this Gem contain a flaw causing the program to create temporary files
    insecurely. It is possible for a local attacker to use a symlink attack
    against the `/tmp/my.cnf.#{target_host}` file they can overwrite
    arbitrary files, gain access to the MySQL root password, or inject
    arbitrary commands.
