  title: refile Gem for Ruby contains a remote code execution vulnerability
  description: |
    refile Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered when input is not
    sanitized when handling the 'remote_image_url' field in a form, where
    'image' is the name of the attachment. This may allow a remote attacker
    to execute arbitrary shell commands.

  unaffected_versions:
  - "< 0.5.0"
  patched_versions:
  - ">= 0.5.4"
