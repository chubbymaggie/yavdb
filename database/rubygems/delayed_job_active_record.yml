  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [`delayed_job_active_record`][1] is backend for Delayed Job, originally
    authored by Tobias L端tke.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-middle
    (MitM) attacks due to downloading gems over an insecure protocol.
    Without a secure connection, it is possible for an attacker to intercept
    this connection and alter the packages received. In serious cases, this
    may even lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on your host server.

    You can read more about `Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)` on our [blog][2].
