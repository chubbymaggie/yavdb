  title: crack Gem for Ruby Type Casting Parameter Parsing Remote Code Execution
  description: |
    crack Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered when a type casting
    error occurs during the parsing of parameters. This may allow a
    context-dependent attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code.

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`crack`][1] is a gem for parsing JSON and XML.

    Affected versions of this gem are vulnerable because they do not
    properly restrict casts of string values. This may allow an attacker to
    execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service (DoS).
