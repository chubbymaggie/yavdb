  title: Arbitrary Command Execution
  description: |
    [sup][1] is a console-based email client for people with a lot of email.
    Affected versions of this gem do not sanitize email attachment content
    when using quotes (\',\") around filename or content\_type which is
    already escaped using Ruby `Shellwords.escape` - this means that the
    string (content\_type, filename) is intended to be used *without* any
    further quotes. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to execute
    arbitrary commands.
