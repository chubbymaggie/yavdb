  title: 'rubygem-rest-client: session fixation vulnerability via Set-Cookie headers
    in 30x redirection responses'
  description: |
    rest-client in abstract_response.rb improperly handles Set-Cookie headers on
    HTTP 30x redirection responses. Any cookies will be forwarded to the
    redirection target regardless of domain, path, or expiration.

    If you control a redirection source, you can cause rest-client to perform a
    request to any third-party domain with cookies of your choosing, which may be
    useful in performing a session fixation attack.

    If you control a redirection target, you can steal any cookies set by the
    third-party redirection request.
