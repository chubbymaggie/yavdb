  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [`railties`][1] is Rails internals: application bootup, plugins,
    generators, and rake tasks.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Timing Attack via the
    runtime header, which returns the amount of time spent on the server.
    You can read more about timing attacks (using Node.js as an example) on
    the Snyk blog: [https://snyk.io/blog/node-js-timing-attack-ccc-ctf/][2]
