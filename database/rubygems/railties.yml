  title: Possible Remote Code Execution Exploit in Rails Development Mode
  description: |
    There is a possible a possible remote code executing exploit in Rails when in
    development mode. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier
    CVE-2019-5420.

    Versions Affected:  6.0.0.X, 5.2.X.
    Not affected:       < 5.2.0
    Fixed Versions:     6.0.0.beta3, 5.2.2.1

    Impact
    ------
    With some knowledge of a target application it is possible for an attacker to
    guess the automatically generated development mode secret token.  This secret
    token can be used in combination with other Rails internals to escalate to a
    remote code execution exploit.

    All users running an affected release should either upgrade or use one of the
    workarounds immediately.

    Releases
    --------
    The 6.0.0.beta3 and 5.2.2.1 releases are available at the normal locations.

    Workarounds
    -----------
    This issue can be mitigated by specifying a secret key in development mode.
    In "config/environments/development.rb" add this:

      config.secret_key_base = SecureRandom.hex(64)

  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [`railties`][1] is Rails internals: application bootup, plugins,
    generators, and rake tasks.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Timing Attack via the
    runtime header, which returns the amount of time spent on the server.
    You can read more about timing attacks (using Node.js as an example) on
    the Snyk blog: [https://snyk.io/blog/node-js-timing-attack-ccc-ctf/][2]
