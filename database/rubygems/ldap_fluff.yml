  title: Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager rubygem-ldap_fluff Active Directory Authentication
    Bypass
  description: Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager contains a flaw in the rubygem-ldap_fluff
    component. The issue is triggered when using Microsoft Active Directory server
    as the authentication back-end. This may result in authentication no longer being
    enforced, allowing a remote attacker to trivially bypass it.
