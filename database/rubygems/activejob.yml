  description: |
    [activejob][1]declares job classes that can be run by a variety of
    queueing backends.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass. Carefully crafted user input can cause Active Job to deserialize
    it using GlobalId and allow an attacker to have access to information
    that they should not have.
