  title: bcrypt-ruby Gem for Ruby incorrect encoding of non US-ASCII characters (JRuby
    only)
  description: |
    bcrypt-ruby Gem for Ruby suffered from a bug related to character
    encoding that substantially reduced the entropy of hashed passwords
    containing non US-ASCII characters. An incorrect encoding step
    transparently replaced such characters by '?' prior to hashing. In the
    worst case of a password consisting solely of non-US-ASCII characters,
    this would cause its hash to be equivalent to all other such passwords
    of the same length. This issue only affects the JRuby implementation.
