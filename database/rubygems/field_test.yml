  title: Improper Input Validation
  description: |
    [field\_test][1] is an A/B testing library for Rails.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Input
    Validation. A method call that is expected to return a value from a
    certain set of inputs can be made to return any input, which can be
    dangerous depending on how applications use it. If an application treats
    arbitrary variants as trusted, this can lead to a variety of potential
    vulnerabilities like SQL Injection or Cross-site Scripting (XSS).
