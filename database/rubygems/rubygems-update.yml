  title: RubyGems Multiple API Call Version Validation CPU Consumption DoS
  description: |
    RubyGems contains a flaw that may allow a denial of service. The issue is
    triggered when handling the gem build, Gem::Package, or Gem::PackageTask API
    calls, which attempt to validate the version of the program. This may allow a
    context-dependent attacker to cause a consumption of CPU resources and crash
    the program.

  title: Delete directory using symlink when decompressing tar
  description: |
    A Directory Traversal issue was discovered in RubyGems 2.7.6 and later
    through 3.0.2. Before making new directories or touching files (which now
    include path-checking code for symlinks), it would delete the target
    destination. If that destination was hidden behind a symlink, a malicious gem
    could delete arbitrary files on the userâ€™s machine, presuming the attacker
    could guess at paths. Given how frequently gem is run as sudo, and how
    predictable paths are on modern systems (/tmp, /usr, etc.), this could
    likely lead to data loss or an unusable system.
