  title: sfpagent Gem for Ruby JSON[body] Module Name Remote Command Execution
  description: |
    sfpagent Gem for Ruby contains a flaw that is triggered as JSON[body]
    input is not properly sanitized when handling module names with shell
    metacharacters. This may allow a context-dependent attacker to execute
    arbitrary commands.

  patched_versions:
  - ">= 0.4.15"
  severity: high
  package_manager: rubygems
  cve:
