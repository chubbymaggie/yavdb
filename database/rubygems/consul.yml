  title: Improper Access Control
  description: |
    [consul][1] is a scope-based authorization solution for Ruby on Rails.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Access
    Control. When a controller has multiple power directives, the `:only`
    and `:except` options of the last directive is applied to all
    directives. This can lead to unauthenticated access to certain
    controller actions.
