  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [`ruby_rncryptor_secured`][1] is an Encryptor and Decryptor for the
    RNCryptor format.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Timing Attacks due to
    not comparing the HMAC hashes in constant time. A malicious user could
    guess the valid HMAC hash during the comparison time with an algorithm.
