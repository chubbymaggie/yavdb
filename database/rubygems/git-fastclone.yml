  title: git-fastclone permits arbitrary shell command execution from .gitmodules
  description: |
    Git allows executing arbitrary shell commands using git-remote-ext via a
    remote URLs. Normally git never requests URLs that the user doesn't
    specifically request, so this is not a serious security concern. However,
    submodules did allow the remote repository to specify what URL to clone
    from.

    If an attacker can instruct a user to run a recursive clone from a
    repository they control, they can get a client to run an arbitrary shell
    command. Alternately, if an attacker can MITM an unencrypted git clone,
    they could exploit this. The ext command will be run if the repository is
    recursively cloned or if submodules are updated. This attack works when
    cloning both local and remote repositories.

  title: git-fastclone Shell Metacharacter Injection Arbitrary Command Execution
  description: |
    git-fastclone before 1.0.5 passes user modifiable strings directly to a shell
    command. An attacker can execute malicious commands by modifying the strings
    that are passed as arguments to "cd " and "git clone " commands in the
    library.

  title: Arbitrary Command Execution
  description: |
    [`git-fastclone`][1] is a git command that uses reference repositories
    and threading to quickly and recursively clone repositories with many
    nested submodules.

    Affected version of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command
    Execution. `git-fastclone` used the `git-remote-ext` command, allowing a
    user to specify remote URLs. An attacker could manipulate a user to run
    a recursive clone from a repository they control, allowing the attacker
    to run arbitrary commands. This attack works when cloning both local and
    remote repositories.
