  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [`bourne`][1]is extends mocha to allow detailed tracking and querying of
    stub and mock invocations.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-middle
    (MitM) attacks due to attacks due to downloading gems over an insecure
    protocol. Without a secure connection, it is possible for an attacker to
    intercept this connection and alter the packages received. In serious
    cases, this may even lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on your host
    server.
