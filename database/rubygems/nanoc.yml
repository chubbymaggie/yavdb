  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [`nanoc`][1] is a static-site generator focused on flexibility. Affected
    versions of the package are vulnerable to Information Exposure.
    Resources embedded within HTML documents were not correctly validated,
    and malicious users could request a protocol that degrades the security
    of the original connection. Browsers do not enforce consistant
    protocols, which could lead to the leakage of private information.
