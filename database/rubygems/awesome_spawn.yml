  title: OS command injection flaw in awesome_spawn
  description: Awesome spawn contains OS command injection vulnerability, which allows
    execution of additional commands passed to Awesome spawn as arguments, e.g. AwesomeSpawn.run('ls',:params
    => {'-l' => ";touch haxored"}). If untrusted input was included in command arguments,
    attacker could use this flaw to execute arbitrary command.
