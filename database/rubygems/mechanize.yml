    [`mechanize`][1] is used for automating interaction with websites.

    Affected versions of the package exposed the http authentication
    credentials. Only one set of HTTP authentication credentials were
    allowed for a connections. If a mechanize instance connected to more
    than one server then a malicious server detecting mechanize could ask
    for HTTP Basic authentication. This would expose the username and
    password intended only for one server.
