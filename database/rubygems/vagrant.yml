  title: Insecure SSH default login
  description: |-
    When building Vagrant base boxes (manually or using tools like Veewee to automate), builders follow the vagrant base boxes specifications which defines the following:

    User root and vagrant use vagrant as password
    Public key authentication (password-less) for the user vagrant.
    Vagrant project provides an insecure key pair for SSH Public Key Authentication so that vagrant ssh works.

    Because everyone has access to the private key, anyone can use the private key to login to your VMs (suppose they know your IP of the host machine, port is by default 2222 as forwarding rules in place.)

    It is NOT secure OOTB. However, you can remove the trusted key from ~vagrant/.ssh/authorized_keys and add your own, change password for vagrant and root, then it's considered relatively safe.

    Since Vagrant 1.2.3, by default SSH forwarded port binds to 127.0.0.1 so only local connections are allowed [GH-1785].
