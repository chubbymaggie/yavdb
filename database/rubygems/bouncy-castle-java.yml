  title: TLS Timing Attack
  description: |
    [bouncy-castle-java][1] is a Gem redistribution of \"Legion of the
    Bouncy Castle Java cryptography APIs\" jars.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to TLS Timing Attack.
    The TLS implementation does not properly consider timing side-channel
    attacks on a noncompliant MAC check operation during the processing of
    malformed CBC padding, which allows remote attackers to conduct
    distinguishing attacks and plaintext-recovery attacks via statistical
    analysis of timing data for crafted packets, a related issue to
    [CVE-2013-0169][2].
