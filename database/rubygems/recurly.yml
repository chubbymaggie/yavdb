  title: SSRF vulnerability in Recurly gem's Resource#find.
  description: |
    If you are using the #find method on any of the classes that are derived from
    the Resource class and you are passing user input into that method, a
    malicious user can force the http client to reach out to a server under their
    control. This can lead to leakage of your private API key.

    Because of the severity of impact, we are recommending that all users upgrade
    to a patched version. We have provided a non-breaking patch for every 2.X
    version of the client.
