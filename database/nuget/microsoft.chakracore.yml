  description: |
    [Microsoft.ChakraCore][1] is the core part of the Chakra Javascript
    engine that powers Microsoft Edge.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). An attacker may bypass the Control Flow Guard (CFG). By
    itself, the vulnerability does not allow arbitrary code execution.
    However, an attacker could use the CFG in conjunction with another
    vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, to run
    arbitrary code on a target system.

  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [Microsoft.ChakraCore][1] is a core part of the Chakra Javascript engine
    that powers Microsoft Edge.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE) due to the way that the scripting engine handles objects
    in memory in Microsoft Edge. The memory can be corrupted so an attacker
    could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An
    attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the
    same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on
    with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited
    the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker
    could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new
    accounts with full user rights.
