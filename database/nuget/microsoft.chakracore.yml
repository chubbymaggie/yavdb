  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [Microsoft.ChakraCore][1] is the core part of the Chakra Javascript
    engine that powers Microsoft Edge.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). An attacker may bypass the Control Flow Guard (CFG). By
    itself, the vulnerability does not allow arbitrary code execution.
    However, an attacker could use the CFG in conjunction with another
    vulnerability, such as a remote code execution vulnerability, to run
    arbitrary code on a target system.

    [Microsoft.ChakraCore][1] is a core part of the Chakra Javascript engine
    that powers Microsoft Edge.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in
    Microsoft Edge as a result of how memory is accessed in code compiled by
    the Edge `Just-In-Time` (JIT) compiler that allows Control Flow Guard
    (CFG) to be bypassed. By itself, this CFG bypass vulnerability does not
    allow arbitrary code execution. However, an attacker could use the CFG
    bypass vulnerability in conjunction with another vulnerability, such as
    a remote code execution vulnerability, to run arbitrary code on a target
    system.

  description: |
    [Microsoft.ChakraCore][1] is a core part of the Chakra Javascript engine
    that powers Microsoft Edge.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE) due to the way that the ChakraCore scripting engine
    handles objects in memory. The vulnerability could corrupt memory in
    such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context
    of the current user. An attacker who successfully exploited the
    vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the current user.

    the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative
    user rights, an attacker could take control of an affected system and
    will be able to install programs; view, change, or delete data; or
    create new accounts with full user rights.

  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [Microsoft.ChakraCore][1] is a core part of the Chakra Javascript engine
    that powers Microsoft Edge.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE) due to the way that the scripting engine handles objects
    in memory in Microsoft Edge. The memory can be corrupted so an attacker
    could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user. An
    attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could gain the
    same user rights as the current user. If the current user is logged on
    with administrative user rights, an attacker who successfully exploited
    the vulnerability could take control of an affected system. An attacker
    could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new
    accounts with full user rights.

  title: Information Disclosure
  description: |
    [Microsoft.ChakraCore][1] is a core part of the Chakra Javascript engine
    that powers Microsoft Edge.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Disclosure because the scripting engine does not properly handle objects
    in memory in Microsoft Edge. An attacker who successfully exploited the
    vulnerability could obtain information to further compromise the user’s
    system.
