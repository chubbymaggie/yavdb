  title: knockout html bindings are dangerous
  description: |-
    Html templates that display a model property or an observable should use Knockout's text binding rather than html binding. For example /app/durandal/messageBox.html contains the html binding for the title and message

    . Html bindings should be avoided because the value is interpreted as html and creates XSS vulnerability.
