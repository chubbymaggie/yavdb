  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: "[`Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.zh-Hans`][1] contains the Simplified Chinese\napplets
    for ASP.NET MVC.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site
    Scripting\n(XSS) attacks via the `System.Web.Mvc.dll` in Microsoft ASP.NET Model\nView
    Controller (MVC).\n\n> The vulnerability could allow security feature bypass if
    an attacker\n> convinces a user to click a specially crafted link or to visit
    a\n> webpage that contains specially crafted content designed to exploit\n> the
    vulnerability. In a web-based attack scenario, an attacker could\n> host a specially
    crafted website that is designed to exploit the\n> vulnerability through a web
    browser, and then convince a user to view\n> the website. The attacker could also
    take advantage of compromised\n> websites and websites that accept or host user-provided
    content or\n> advertisements. These websites could contain specially crafted content\n>
    that could exploit the vulnerability. In all cases, however, an\n> attacker would
    have no way to force users to view the\n> attacker-controlled content. Instead,
    an attacker would have to\n> convince users to take action, typically by getting
    them to click a\n> link in an email message or in an Instant Messenger message
    that takes\n> them to the attacker\\'s website, or by getting them to open an\n>
    attachment sent through email.\n> \n> * Microsoft Security Bulletin MS14-059\n\n\n\n[1]:
    https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc.zh-Hans\n\\nCross-Site Scripting
    (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker tricks a\nuser’s browser to execute malicious
    JavaScript code in the context of a\nvictim’s domain. Such scripts can steal the
    user’s session cookies for\nthe domain, scrape or modify its content, and perform
    or modify actions\non the user’s behalf, actions typically blocked by the browser’s
    Same\nOrigin Policy.\n\nThese attacks are possible by escaping the context of
    the web\napplication and injecting malicious scripts in an otherwise trusted\nwebsite.
    These scripts can introduce additional attributes (say, a\n\\\"new\\\" option
    in a dropdown list or a new link to a malicious site) and\ncan potentially execute
    code on the clients side, unbeknown to the\nvictim. This occurs when characters
    like `<` `>` `\"` `'` are not escaped\nproperly.\n\nThere are a few types of XSS:\n\n*
    **Persistent XSS** is an attack in which the malicious code persists\n  into the
    web app’s database.\n* **Reflected XSS** is an which the website echoes back a
    portion of the\n  request. The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking
    a\n  malicious link (for instance through a phishing email or malicious JS\n  on
    another page), which triggers the XSS attack.\n* **DOM-based XSS** is an that
    occurs purely in the browser when\n  client-side JavaScript echoes back a portion
    of the URL onto the page.\n  DOM-Based XSS is notoriously hard to detect, as the
    server never gets\n  a chance to see the attack taking place.\n\n"
