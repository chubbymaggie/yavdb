  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`][1] contains common action result
    types, attribute routing, application model conventions, API explorer,
    application parts, filters, formatters, model binding, and more.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation. `View Components` could receive incorrect information,
    including the details of the current authenticated user. If a `View
    Component` depends on the vulnerable code and makes decisions based on
    the current user, then the it could make incorrect decisions that result
    in elevation of privilege.

    [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`][1] contains common action result
    types, attribute routing, application model conventions, API explorer,
    application parts, filters, formatters, model binding, and more.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DOS) via a malformed HTTP request.



    [1]: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

    [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`][1] contains common action result

    application parts, filters, formatters, model binding, and more.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS) attacks.

    A denial of service vulnerability exists when the `ASP.NET Core` fails
    to properly validate web requests.

    **NOTE:** Microsoft has not commented on third-party claims that the
    issue is that the `TextEncoder.EncodeCore` function in the
    `System.Text.Encodings.Web` package in ASP.NET Core Mvc before 1.0.4 and
    1.1.x before 1.1.3 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    by leveraging failure to properly calculate the length of 4-byte
    characters in the Unicode Non-Character range.

    [`Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Core`][1] contains common action result
    types, attribute routing, application model conventions, API explorer,

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable due to Improper

    Security Usage* tagging when they present a certificate that is invalid
    for a specific use.
