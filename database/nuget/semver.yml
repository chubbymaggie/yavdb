  title: Regular Expression Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |
    The semver module uses regular expressions when parsing a version
    string. For a carefully crafted input, the time it takes to process
    these regular expressions is not linear to the length of the input.
    Since the semver module did not enforce a limit on the version string
    length, an attacker could provide a long string that would take up a
    large amount of resources, potentially taking a server down. This issue
    therefore enables a potential Denial of Service attack. This is a
    slightly differnt variant of a typical Regular Expression Denial of
    Service ([ReDoS][1]) vulnerability.
