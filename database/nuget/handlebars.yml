  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: |+
    Previously, only &lt; and &gt; were escaped. This meant that any
    Handlebars template that used user input in an HTML attribute value was
    wide open to a trivial XSS exploit. Note that unquoted attribute values
    are still open to attack, but this set of characters at least brings
    Handlebars in line with other Mustache implementations and other
    template languages.

    \nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker tricks a
    user’s browser to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a
    victim’s domain. Such scripts can steal the user’s session cookies for
    the domain, scrape or modify its content, and perform or modify actions
    on the user’s behalf, actions typically blocked by the browser’s Same
    Origin Policy.

    These attacks are possible by escaping the context of the web
    application and injecting malicious scripts in an otherwise trusted
    website. These scripts can introduce additional attributes (say, a
    \"new\" option in a dropdown list or a new link to a malicious site) and
    can potentially execute code on the clients side, unbeknown to the
    victim. This occurs when characters like `<` `>` `"` `'` are not escaped
    properly.

    There are a few types of XSS:

    * **Persistent XSS** is an attack in which the malicious code persists
      into the web app’s database.
    * **Reflected XSS** is an which the website echoes back a portion of the
      request. The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking a
      malicious link (for instance through a phishing email or malicious JS
      on another page), which triggers the XSS attack.
    * **DOM-based XSS** is an that occurs purely in the browser when
      client-side JavaScript echoes back a portion of the URL onto the page.
      DOM-Based XSS is notoriously hard to detect, as the server never gets
      a chance to see the attack taking place.

  title: Content Injection (XSS)
  description: |+
    When using attributes without quotes in a handlebars template, an
    attacker can manipulate the input to introduce additional attributes,
    potentially executing code. This may lead to a Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS) vulnerability, assuming an attacker can influence the value
    entered into the template. If the handlebars template is used to render
    user-generated content, this vulnerability may escalate to a persistent
    XSS vulnerability.

    **Example:**

    Assume handlebars was used to display user comments and avatar, using
    the following template: `<img src={{avatarUrl}}><pre>{{comment}}</pre>`

    If an attacker spoofed their avatar URL and provided the following
    value: `http://evil.org/avatar.png onload=alert(document.cookie)`

    The resulting HTML would be the following, triggering the script once
    the image loads: `<img src=http://evil.org/avatar.png
    onload=alert(document.cookie)><pre>Gotcha!</pre>`
