  title: Vulnerability in AntiXSS Library Could Allow Information Disclosure
  description: This security update resolves one privately reported vulnerability
    in the Microsoft Anti-Cross Site Scripting (AntiXSS) Library. The vulnerability
    could allow information disclosure if an attacker passes a malicious script to
    a website using the sanitization function of the AntiXSS Library. The consequences
    of the disclosure of that information depends on the nature of the information
    itself. Note that this vulnerability would not allow an attacker to execute code
    or to elevate the attacker's user rights directly, but it could be used to produce
    information that could be used to try to further compromise the affected system.
    Only sites that use the sanitization module of the AntiXSS Library are affected
    by this vulnerability.
