  title: Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip)
  description: |
    [System.IO.Compression.ZipFile][1] provides classes that support the
    compression and decompression of streams using file system paths.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write
    via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip). An attacker could write arbitrary
    files and directories to certain locations on a vulnerable system.
    However, an attacker would have limited control over the destination of
    the files and directories. To exploit the vulnerability, they must send
    a specially crafted file to a vulnerable system.
