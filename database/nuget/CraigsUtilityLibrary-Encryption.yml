  title: Default Salt Use
  description: |-
    "See here: https://github.com/JaCraig/Craig-s-Utility-Library/blob/master/Utilities/IO/Encryption/BaseClasses/SymmetricBase.cs#L140

    This code supplies a default salt of Kosher - this use defeats the purpose. Please here here for a detailed discussion of how salts should be applied - the key point is that to be effective, they should be random. Relying on a fixed or default salt defeats the purpose.

    I would suggest removing the default, and add a method to generate a random salt using a CSPRNG."

  title: Use of default initialization vector
  description: |-
    "The use of a default initialzation vector is a security flaw - see here for a breakdown of why this is a bad idea, that document goes into detail for how IVs should be handled for CBC mode, so I won't repeat it all here.

    To protect the integrity of encrypted data, this default IV should not be used."
