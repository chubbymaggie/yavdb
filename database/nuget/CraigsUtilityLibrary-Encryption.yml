  title: Use of default initialization vector
  description: |-
    "The use of a default initialzation vector is a security flaw - see here for a breakdown of why this is a bad idea, that document goes into detail for how IVs should be handled for CBC mode, so I won't repeat it all here.

    To protect the integrity of encrypted data, this default IV should not be used."
