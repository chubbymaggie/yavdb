  title: Possible Cross Site Scripting vulnerability (XSS)
  description: |-
    [Release 1.5.1] is a bug fix release and fixes a potential XSS issue with server-side rendering. JSON.NET does not escape HTML characters in its JSON output by default. As ReactJS.NET uses JSON.NET to output the props of server-side rendered components, a prop that accepts arbitrary user input could potentially contain script tags, allowing for XSS.

    Escaping of HTML is now enabled by default.
