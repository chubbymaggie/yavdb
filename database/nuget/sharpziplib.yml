  title: Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip)
  description: |
    [`sharpziplib`][1] is a Zip, GZip, Tar and BZip2 library written
    entirely in C# for the .NET platform.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File Write
    via Archive Extraction (AKA \"Zip Slip\").

    It can be exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds
    path traversal filenames. When exploited, a filename in a malicious
    archive is concatenated to the target extraction directory, which
    results in the final path ending up outside of the target folder. For
    instance, a zip may hold a file with a `../../file.exe` location and
    thus break out of the target folder. If an executable or a configuration
    file is overwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem
    can turn into an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.

    The following is an example of a zip archive with one benign file and
    one malicious file. Extracting the malicous file will result in
    traversing out of the target folder, ending up in `/root/.ssh/`
    overwriting the `authorized_keys` file:

        ++2018-04-15 22:04:29 .....           19           19  good.txt
        ++2018-04-15 22:04:42 .....           20           20  ../../../../../../root/.ssh/authorized_keys
