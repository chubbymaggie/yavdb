  title: Insecure Defaults
  description: |
    [engine.io-client][1], the client for [engine.io][2] and [socket.io][3],
    disables the core SSL/TLS verification checks by default.

    This allows an active attacker, for instance one operating a malicious
    WiFi, to intercept these encrypted connections using the attacker\'s
    spoofed certificate and keys. Doing so compromises the data communicated
    over this channel, as well as allowing an attacker to impersonate both
    the server and the client during the live session, sending spoofed data
    to either side.
