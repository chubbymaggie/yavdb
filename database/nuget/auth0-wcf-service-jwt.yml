  title: JWT Token Exposure
  description: |
    [Auth0-WCF-Service-JWT][1] is a ServiceAuthorizationManager from WCF
    that will extract the bearer JWT from Authorization header, validate it
    and then set the principal to a ClaimsPrincipal.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to JWT Token Exposure.
    The library leaked a token signature in an error message which would
    allow an attacker to forge an arbitrary JWT token.
