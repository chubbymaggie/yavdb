  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [`opcfoundation.netstandard.opc.ua`][1] contains the OPC UA reference
    implementation and is targeting the .NET Standard Library.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Information Exposure.
    A remote attacker could determine the Server’s private key by sending
    carefully constructed bad `UserIdentityTokens`.

    **NOTE** This attack only affects `UserIdentityTokens` encrypted with
    the `Basic128Rsa15` Security Policy which has already been depreciated.
