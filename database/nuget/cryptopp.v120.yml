  title: "[CVE-2015-2141]  Information Exposure"
  description: The InvertibleRWFunction::CalculateInverse function in rw.cpp in libcrypt++
    5.6.2 does not properly blind private key operations for the Rabin-Williams digital
    signature algorithm, which allows remote attackers to obtain private keys via
    a timing attack.

  title: "[CVE-2016-7420]  Information Exposure"
  description: Crypto++ (aka cryptopp) through 5.6.4 does not document the requirement
    for a compile-time NDEBUG definition disabling the many assert calls that are
    unintended in production use, which might allow context-dependent attackers to
    obtain sensitive information by leveraging access to process memory after an assertion
    failure, as demonstrated by reading a core dump.

  title: "[CVE-2016-9939]  Improper Input Validation"
  description: Crypto++ (aka cryptopp and libcrypto++) 5.6.4 contained a bug in its
    ASN.1 BER decoding routine. The library will allocate a memory block based on
    the length field of the ASN.1 object. If there is not enough content octets in
    the ASN.1 object, then the function will fail and the memory block will be zeroed
    even if its unused. There is a noticeable delay during the wipe for a large allocation.
