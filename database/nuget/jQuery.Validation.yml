  title: XSS attacks against included PHP files
  description: These issues come down to XSS "attacks" via the included php files.
    Not a big deal really, though instead of trying to patch those files, I'd rather
    get rid of them completely. The unit tests already make use of mockjax to get
    rid of actual server side scripts, we should be able to do that for the other
    demo php files as well.
