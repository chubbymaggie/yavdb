  title: Domain-Spoofing
  description: |
    [Microsoft.NETCore.App][1] is a set of .NET API\'s that are included in
    the default .NET Core application model.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Domain-Spoofing. It
    causes the meaning of a URI to change when International Domain Name
    encoding is applied. An attacker who successfully exploited the
    vulnerability could redirect a URI.

  title: Authentication Bypass by Spoofing
  description: |
    [Microsoft.NETCore.App][1] is a set of .NET API\'s that are included in
    the default .NET Core application model.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass by Spoofing due to the way they parse URL\'s. An attacker could
    use it to bypass security logic intended to ensure that a user-provided
    URL belonged to a specific hostname or a subdomain of that hostname. To
    exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must provide a URL string to an
    application that attempts to verify that the URL belongs to a specific
    hostname or to a subdomain of that hostname. The application must then
    make an HTTP request to the attacker-provided URL either directly or by
    sending a processed version of the attacker-provided URL to a web
    browser.

  title: Denial Of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [Microsoft.NETCore.App][1] is a set of .NET API\'s that are included in
    the default .NET Core application model.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial Of Service
    (DoS) due to improperly handling parsing certificate data. An attacker
    who successfully exploited this vulnerability could cause a denial of
    service against a .NET Core web application.



    [1]: https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.NETCore.App
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

    [Microsoft.NETCore.App][1] is set of .NET API\'s that are included in
    the default .NET Core application model.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). An unauthenticated attacker can cause a denial of service
    remotely, by issuing specially crafted requests to the .NET Core
    application. This is caused by an improper handling of a web request in
    ASP.NET Core. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2019-0548.
