  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [`Kallithea`][1] is a fast and powerful management tool for Mercurial
    and Git with a built in push/pull server, full text search and
    code-review.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF) attacks. The lack of CSRF protection in the POST forms
    aenabled attackers trick users into performing a specific action, and
    changing their input in the HTTP POST request.

  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: |
    [`kallithea`][1] is a fast and powerful management tool for Mercurial
    and Git with a built in push/pull server, full text search and
    code-review.

    Affected Versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Scripting
    (XSS) attacks. Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in
    the administration pages in Kallithea before 0.2.1 allow remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the (1) first name
    or (2) last name user details, or the (3) repository, (4) repository
    group, or (5) user group description.

    \nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker tricks a
    user’s browser to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a
    victim’s domain. Such scripts can steal the user’s session cookies for
    the domain, scrape or modify its content, and perform or modify actions
    on the user’s behalf, actions typically blocked by the browser’s Same
    Origin Policy.

    These attacks are possible by escaping the context of the web
    application and injecting malicious scripts in an otherwise trusted
    website. These scripts can introduce additional attributes (say, a
    \"new\" option in a dropdown list or a new link to a malicious site) and
    can potentially execute code on the clients side, unbeknown to the
    victim. This occurs when characters like `<` `>` `"` `'` are not escaped
    properly.

    There are a few types of XSS:

    * **Persistent XSS** is an attack in which the malicious code persists
      into the web app’s database.
    * **Reflected XSS** is an which the website echoes back a portion of the
      request. The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking a
      malicious link (for instance through a phishing email or malicious JS
      on another page), which triggers the XSS attack.
    * **DOM-based XSS** is an that occurs purely in the browser when
      client-side JavaScript echoes back a portion of the URL onto the page.
      DOM-Based XSS is notoriously hard to detect, as the server never gets
      a chance to see the attack taking place.

    You can read more about `Cross-site Scripting (XSS)` on our [blog][1].

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF) attacks. It allows remote attackers to bypass the CSRF
    protection by using the GET HTTP request method.
