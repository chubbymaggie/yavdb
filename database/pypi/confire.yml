  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`confire`][1] is a simple app configuration scheme using YAML and class
    based defaults.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML parsing
    functionality in config.py in Confire 0.2.0. Due to the user-specific
    configuration being loaded from \"/.confire.yaml\" using the yaml.load
    function, a YAML parser can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting
    in command execution. An attacker can insert Python into loaded YAML to
    trigger this vulnerability.
