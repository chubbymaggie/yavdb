  title: BSON Corruption
  description: |
    [`bson`][1] is a BSON codec for Python.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to BSON Corruption. A
    malicious user can insert a null byte into a cstring when encoding,
    which can terminate the string early. This can lead to BSON document
    corruption, and depending on how the application uses `bson`,
    potentially lead to buffer overflow.
