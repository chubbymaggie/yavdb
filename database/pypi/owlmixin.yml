  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`owlmixin`][1] is tools for convenient interface creation over various
    types of data in a declarative way.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML loading
    functionality of util.py in OwlMixin before 2.0.0a12. A \"Load YAML\"
    string or file (aka load\_yaml or load\_yamlf) can execute arbitrary
    Python commands resulting in command execution because load is used
    where safe\_load should have been used. An attacker can insert Python
    into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability.
