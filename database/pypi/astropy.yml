  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [astropy][1] is a package intended to contain much of the core
    functionality and some common tools needed for performing astronomy and
    astrophysics with Python.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. It bundles the CFITSIO open source software project which
    contains vulnerabilities that could allow a remote, unauthenticated
    attacker to take control of a server running the CFITSIO software.
