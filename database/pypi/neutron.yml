  title: Insecure Defaults
  description: |
    [neutron][1] is an OpenStack project to provide “network connectivity as
    a service” between interface devices (e.g., vNICs) managed by other
    OpenStack services (e.g., nova). It implements the Neutron API.

    Affected versions of this package have a Insecure Defaults. Setting a
    destination port in a security group rule along with a protocol that
    doesn\'t support that option (for example, VRRP), may allow an
    authenticated user to block further application of security group rules
    for instances from any project/tenant on the compute hosts to which
    it\'s applied.

    *Note: Only deployments using the iptables security group driver are
    affected.*
