  title: HTTP Response Splitting
  description: |
    [`waitress`][1] is a Waitress WSGI server.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP response
    splitting attacks. It is possible to set arbitrary headers in the HTTP
    response by embedding a \\r or \\n character in the header value, and
    sending it to the server.

  title: WSGI header spoofing
  description: |
    [`waitress`][1] is a Waitress WSGI server.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to WSGI header
    spoofing. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by using an
    `_` character instead of a `-` in an HTTP header. In the WSGI environ,
    the `X-Auth-User` and the `X-Auth_User` headers are both converted to
    `HTTP_X_Auth_User`, allowing the attacker to bypass the protection. This
    vulnerability is related to [CVE-2015-0219][2]
