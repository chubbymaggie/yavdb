  title: '[CVE-2014-1624]  Improper Link Resolution Before File Access ("Link Following")'
  description: Race condition in the xdg.BaseDirectory.get_runtime_dir function in
    python-xdg 0.25 allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files by pre-creating
    /tmp/pyxdg-runtime-dir-fallback-victim to point to a victim-owned location, then
    replacing it with a symlink to an attacker-controlled location once the get_runtime_dir
    function is called.

  title: Arbitrary Command Execution
  description: |
    [pyxdg][1] contains implementations of freedesktop.org standards in
    python.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command
    Execution via the `xdg.Menu.parse()` function. When it is possible to
    craft an evil `menu` file with a `Category` node containing Python
    injected code. Then it is possible to update `xdg_config_dirs` with its
    location folder, the evil menu can be parsed and an attacker could
    exploit the vulnerability. This is due to a lack of sanitization in
    `xdg/Menu.py`. When the evil `menu` file is parsed, the injected code is
    executed because of an unsanitized `eval()`.
