  description: Docker before 1.3.1 and docker-py before 0.5.3 fall back to HTTP when
    the HTTPS connection to the registry fails, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers
    to conduct downgrade attacks and obtain authentication and image data by leveraging
    a network position between the client and the registry to block HTTPS traffic.

  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [`docker_py`][1] is a Python client for Docker. Docker before 1.3.1 and
    docker-py before 0.5.3 fall back to HTTP when the HTTPS connection to
    the registry fails, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers to conduct
    downgrade attacks and obtain authentication and image data by leveraging
    a network position between the client and the registry to block HTTPS
    traffic.
