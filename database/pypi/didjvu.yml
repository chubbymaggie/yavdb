  title: Arbitrary File Creation
  description: |
    [`didjvu`][1] Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to
    Arbitrary File Creation via a race condition. There is a window between
    the creation

    It creates a unique temporary file directly in `/tmp` and passes the
    temp file\'s name to `c44` to be used as the output file name. `c44`
    then deletes the output file and creates a new one under the same name
    without the `O_EXCL` parameter. This opens a race window, during which a
    malicious local user could create their own file under this name.
