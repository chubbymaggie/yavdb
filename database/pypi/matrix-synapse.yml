  title: Insufficient Verification of Data Authenticity
  description: |
    [matrix-synapse][1] is an ecosystem for open federated Instant Messaging
    and VoIP.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insufficient
    Verification of Data Authenticity as it mishandles signature checking on
    some federation APIs. Events sent over `/send_join`, `/send_leave`, and
    `/invite` may not be correctly signed, or may not come from expected
    hosts.
