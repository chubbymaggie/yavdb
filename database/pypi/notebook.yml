  title: Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [`notebook`][1] is a web-based notebook environment for interactive
    computing.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-site Request
    Forgery (CSRF) attacks due to improper validation of the CSRF token. A
    malicious user may be able to spawn new kernels and create empty,
    untitled files on the user\'s notebook server.

    **Note:** This affects users of Firefox or Microsoft (IE, Edge)
    browsers, and any other browsers that do not set the Origin header on
    cross-site forms. WebKit and Blink based browsers like Safari and Chrome
    are not affected.
