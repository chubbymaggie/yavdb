  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    Affected versions of [`ansible-vault`][1] are vulnerable to Arbitrary
    Code Execution.

    Ansible Vault uses an encrypted format to enable users to store
    potential secrets (passwords, etc) that are needed for automating tasks.

    Prior to version 1.0.5, Ansible Vault used the unsafe `yaml.load()`
    method to load the yaml file that it ultimately encrypts. If that yaml
    file contains a carefully coded python directive, the `yaml.load()`
    method will enable arbitrary commands to be executed.
