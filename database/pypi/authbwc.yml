  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [`authbwc`][1] is a user authentication and authorization component for
    the BlazeWeb framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation. It was possible for a user to gain the permissions of the
    user logged in previously due to the way the HTTP session user
    permissions were loaded. A malicious user can log in after an admin has
    been logged in and not logged out, and gain their privileges.
