  title: Arbitrary Code Injection
  description: |
    [aioxmpp][1] is a pure-python XMPP library using the asyncio standard
    library module from Python 3.4.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Injection due to an improper handling of structural elements in Stanza
    parser. A crafted stanza could be sent to an application which uses the
    vulnerable components to either inject data in a different context or
    cause the application to reconnect.
