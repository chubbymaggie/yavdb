  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`ovs`][1] is a Open vSwitch library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS).



    [1]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ovs
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)

    [`ovs`][1] is Open vSwitch library.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). In Open vSwitch (OvS) 2.7.0, while parsing an
    OFPT\_QUEUE\_GET\_CONFIG\_REPLY type OFP 1.0 message, there is a buffer
    over-read that is caused by an unsigned integer underflow in the
    function `ofputil_pull_queue_get_config_reply10` in `lib/ofp-util.c`.

    [`ovs`][1] is Open vSwitch library.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS). In lib/conntrack.c in the firewall implementation in Open vSwitch
    (OvS) 2.6.1, there is a buffer over-read while parsing malformed TCP,
    UDP, and IPv6 packets in the functions `extract_l3_ipv6`,
    `extract_l4_tcp`, and `extract_l4_udp` that can be triggered remotely.
