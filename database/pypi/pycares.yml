  title: Out-of-bounds Memory Write
  description: |
    [`pycares`][1] is a Python interface for c-ares.

    Heap-based buffer overflow in the ares\_create\_query function in c-ares
    1.x before 1.12.0 allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service
    (out-of-bounds write) or possibly execute arbitrary code via a hostname
    with an escaped trailing dot.
