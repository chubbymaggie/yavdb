  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [asyncssh][1] is a Python package which provides an asynchronous client
    and server implementation of the SSHv2 protocol on top of the Python
    3.4+ asyncio framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. It does not properly check whether authentication is completed
    before processing other requests. A customized SSH client can simply
    skip the authentication step.
