  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`mlalchemy`][1] is a library for converting YAML/JSON to SQLAlchemy
    SELECT queries.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML parsing
    functionality in the parse\_yaml\_query method in parser.py in MLAlchemy
    before 0.2.2. When processing YAML-Based queries for data, a YAML parser
    can execute arbitrary Python commands resulting in command execution
    because load is used where safe\_load should have been used. An attacker
    can insert Python into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability.
