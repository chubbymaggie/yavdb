  title: "[CVE-2016-6581]  Resource Management Errors"
  description: A HTTP/2 implementation built using any version of the Python HPACK
    library between v1.0.0 and v2.2.0 could be targeted for a denial of service attack,
    specifically a so-called "HPACK Bomb" attack. This attack occurs when an attacker
    inserts a header field that is exactly the size of the HPACK dynamic header table
    into the dynamic header table. The attacker can then send a header block that
    is simply repeated requests to expand that field in the dynamic table. This can
    lead to a gigantic compression ratio of 4,096 or better, meaning that 16kB of
    data can decompress to 64MB of data on the target machine.

  title: Denial of Service (DoS)
  description: |+
    [`hpack`][1] is a Pure-Python HPACK header compression.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Denial of Service
    (DoS) attacks.



    [1]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hpack
    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
