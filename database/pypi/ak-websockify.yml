  title: Remote Code Execution via Buffer Overflow (C library only)
  description: |-
    By forcing websockify to iterate multiple times, attackers can
    cause the code to write data past the space allocated for the
    handshake buffer, thereby corrupting adjacent memory.

    It is possible to successfully exploit this buffer overflow
    vulnerability and to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
