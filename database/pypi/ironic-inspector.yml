  title: SQL Injection
  description: |
    [ironic-inspector][1] is a hardware introspection daemon for OpenStack
    Ironic.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to SQL Injection. The
    `node_cache.find_node()` function generates a SQL query using unfiltered
    data from a server\'s reporting inspection results. Due to the API being
    unauthenticated, the flaw could be exploited by an attacker with access
    to the network on which ironic-inspector is listening.

    Because of how the results of the query are used, it is not possible to
    exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate data. However, it could be
    exploited to conduct Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by passing
    malicious data such as `\'; DROP DATABASE;\`
