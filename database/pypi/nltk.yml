  title: Arbitrary File Write via Archive Extraction (Zip Slip)
  description: "[nltk][1] is a Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is a Python package
    for\nnatural language processing.\n\nAffected versions of this package are vulnerable
    to Arbitrary File Write\nvia Archive Extraction (Zip Slip). It allows attackers
    to write\narbitrary files via a `../` (dot dot slash) in an NLTK package (ZIP\narchive)
    that is mishandled during extraction.\n\n\n\n[1]: http://www.nltk.org\n\\nIt is
    exploited using a specially crafted zip archive, that holds path\ntraversal filenames.
    When exploited, a filename in a malicious archive\nis concatenated to the target
    extraction directory, which results in the\nfinal path ending up outside of the
    target folder. For instance, a zip\nmay hold a file with a \\\"../../file.exe\\\"
    location and thus break out of\nthe target folder. If an executable or a configuration
    file is\noverwritten with a file containing malicious code, the problem can turn\ninto
    an arbitrary code execution issue quite easily.\n\nThe following is an example
    of a zip archive with one benign file and\none malicious file. Extracting the
    malicous file will result in\ntraversing out of the target folder, ending up in
    `/root/.ssh/`\noverwriting the `authorized_keys` file:\n\n    \n    +2018-04-15
