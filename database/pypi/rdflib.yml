  title: Arbitrary Code Injection
  description: |
    [rdflib][1] is a Python library for working with RDF, a simple yet
    powerful language for representing information.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Injection. The CLI tools in `RDFLib` can load Python modules from the
    current working directory, allowing code injection, this is due to
    `python -m` looking in this directory, as demonstrated by `rdf2dot`.
