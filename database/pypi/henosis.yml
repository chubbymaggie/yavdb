  title: Arbitrary Code Injection
  description: |
    [henosis][1] is a Python framework for deploying recommendation models
    for form fields.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution via the `yaml.load` function. It used the unsafe `yaml.load()`
    method to load the yaml file that it ultimately encrypts. If that yaml
    file contains a carefully coded python directive, the `yaml.load()`
    method will enable arbitrary commands to be executed.
