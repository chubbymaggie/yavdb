  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`django_make_app`][1] is define models and fields using YAML and
    generate app for Django with views, forms, templates etc.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML parsing
    functionality in the read\_yaml\_file method in io\_utils.py in
    django\_make\_app 0.1.3. A YAML parser can execute arbitrary Python
    commands resulting in command execution. An attacker can insert Python
    into loaded YAML to trigger this vulnerability.
