  title: Malicious Package
  description: |
    `telnet` is a one of 10 malicious packages that use [typosquatting][1]
    to bait unknowing users to install them. These packages, which carry
    similar names to an original package, offer all the functionality of
    their original, but also include malicious code that collected
    information on infected hosts, such as the username of the user who
    installed the package, and the user\'s computer hostname. It is also
    possible that the packages collected SSH key information.

    The collected data, which looked like `Y:urllib-1.21.1 admin
    testmachine`, was uploaded to a Chinese IP address at
    `121.42.217.44:8080`.

    This is especially dangerous in production runtime environments, where
    environment variables tend to consist of keys, passwords, tokens and
    other secrets.

    On September 15th, 2017 pypi deprecated all malicious typosquatting
    libraries from this list.

    The full list of packages are:
