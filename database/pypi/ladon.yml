  title: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
  description: |
    [Ladon][1] is a framework for exposing python methods to several
    internet service protocols.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to XML External Entity
    (XXE) Injection. The vulnerability exploits the XML External Entity
    (XXE) processing in the SOAP request handlers. For instance, an attacker
    could send a specially crafted SOAP call to craft request handlers,
    resulting in the attacker being able to read files and pivot to other
    internal endpoints.
