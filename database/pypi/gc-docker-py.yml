  title: "[CVE-2014-5277]  Code"
  description: Docker before 1.3.1 and docker-py before 0.5.3 fall back to HTTP when
    the HTTPS connection to the registry fails, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers
    to conduct downgrade attacks and obtain authentication and image data by leveraging
    a network position between the client and the registry to block HTTPS traffic.
