  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [`cipher_googlepam`][1] is a Google PAM Module (defunct).

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass due to using the same cache key for all users. When one user
    logged in successfully, other users could not log in with their own
    passwords. The first user could now use his password to log in as anyone
    else.
