  title: Decryption Attacks
  description: |
    [`attic`][1] is a Deduplicated backups.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to decryption attacks.
    It is possible for the client to determine whether to encrypt the sent
    data, via a query to the server. An attacker may disable the encryption
    by deleting the storage on the server and specifying encryption to be
    off. On the next automated backup, the client will send data unencrypted
    to the server, including passwords and passphrases.
