    [`rply`][1] is a pure Python Lex/Yacc that works with RPython

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure use of
    temporary file attacks. The parser cache functionality in
    parsergenerator.py in RPLY (aka python-rply) before 0.7.1 allows local
    users to spoof cache data by pre-creating a temporary `rply-*.json` file
    with a predictable name.
