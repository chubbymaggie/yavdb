  title: Open Redirect
  description: |
    [`django-revproxy`][1] is a simple reverse proxy using Django. It allows
    to use Django as a reverse Proxy to HTTP requets. It also allows to use
    Django as an authentication Proxy.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect
    attacks. When a colon is present in the URL path, the `urljoin` method
    ignores the upstream request and redirects it to a path cntrolled by an
    attacker, possibly causing content injection.
