  title: Incorrect Access Control
  description: |
    [octavia][1] is a operator-grade reference implementation for Load
    Balancing as a Service (LBaaS) for OpenStack.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Incorrect Access
    Control. `_extract_amp_image_id_by_tag` within
    `octavia/compute/drivers/nova_driver.py` does not filter images and use
    images owned by pre-defined tenant. This could allow any non-admin
    tenant to tag an image with the \'amphora\' tag and set it to
    `public=True`.

    Note: Exploitation of this vulnerability requires configuration of your
    instance to allow any tenant to post public images, which is not enabled
    in default configuration.
