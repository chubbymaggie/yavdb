  title: DNS Rebinding
  description: |
    [mitmproxy][1] is An interactive, SSL-capable, man-in-the-middle HTTP
    proxy for penetration testers and software developers.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to DNS Rebinding. The
    `mitmweb` interface did not include protection against DNS rebinding.
    This could be exploited by a malicious website to either access the
    sniffed data or run arbitrary Python scripts on the filesystem by
    setting the scripts config option.
