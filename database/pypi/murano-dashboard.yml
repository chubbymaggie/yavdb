  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`murano_dashboard`][1] is a The Murano Dashboard OpenStack Murano
    before 1.0.3 (liberty) and 2.x before 2.0.1 (mitaka), Murano-dashboard
    before 1.0.3 (liberty) and 2.x before 2.0.1 (mitaka), and
    python-muranoclient before 0.7.3 (liberty) and 0.8.x before 0.8.5
    (mitaka) improperly use loaders inherited from yaml.Loader when parsing
    MuranoPL and UI files, which allows remote attackers to create arbitrary
    Python objects and execute arbitrary code via crafted extended YAML tags
    in UI definitions in packages.
