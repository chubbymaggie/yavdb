  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [`birdhousebuilder_recipe_nginx`][1] is a Buildout recipe to install and
    configure Nginx with conda.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM) attacks. The SSLv3 protocol uses nondeterministic CBC padding,
    which makes it easier for Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attackers to obtain
    cleartext data via a padding-oracle attack. This is also known as the
    POODLE vulnerability.
