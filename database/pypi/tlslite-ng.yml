  title: Improper Validation of Integrity Check
  description: |
    [tlslite-ng][1] is an open source python library that implements SSL and
    TLS cryptographic protocols.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Improper Validation
    of Integrity Check. It can result in an attacker manipulating the TLS
    ciphertext which will not be detected by receiving tlslite-ng.
