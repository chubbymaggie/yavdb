  title: Arbitrary File Overwrite
  description: |
    [pyro][1] is a Distributed Object Technology system written entirely in
    Python, that is designed to be very easy to use.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File
    Overwrite. It handled `pid` files in temporary directory locations and
    was opening the `pid` file as root. An attacker could use this flaw to
    overwrite arbitrary files via symlinks.
