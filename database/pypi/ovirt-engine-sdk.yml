  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: "[`ovirt-engine-sdk`][1] is a SDK interface to oVirt Virtualization.\n\nAffected
    versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle\n(MitM).  \nIt was
    reported that oVirt\\'s Python SDK does not verify that the\nhostname of the remote
    endpoint matches the Common Name (CN) or\nsubjectAltName as specified by its x.509
    certificate in a TLS/SSL\nsession. This could allow man-in-the-middle attackers
    to spoof remote\nendpoints via an arbitrary yet valid certificate.\n\n\n\n[1]:
