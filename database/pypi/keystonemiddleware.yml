    [`keystonemiddleware`][1] is a Middleware for OpenStack Identity
    Keystonemiddleware is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack.
    When the insecure option is set in the paste.ini file,
    keystonemiddleware will always disable certificate verification,
    regardless of the variables value.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Restriction

    The identity service in OpenStack Identity (Keystone) before 2015.1.3
    (Kilo) and 8.0.x before 8.0.2 (Liberty) and keystonemiddleware (formerly
    python-keystoneclient) before 1.5.4 (Kilo) and Liberty before 2.3.3 does
    not properly invalidate authorization tokens when using the PKI or PKIZ
    token providers, which allows remote authenticated users to bypass
    intended access restrictions and gain access to cloud resources by
    manipulating byte fields within a revoked token.
