  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [rpyc][1] is a transparent library for symmetrical remote procedure
    calls, clustering, and distributed-computing.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). It allows a remote attacker to dynamically modify
    object attributes to construct a remote procedure call that executes
    code for an RPyC service with default configuration settings.
