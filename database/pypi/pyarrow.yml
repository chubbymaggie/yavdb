  title: Use of Uninitialized Variable
  description: |
    [pyarrow][1] is a Python API for functionality provided by the Arrow C++
    libraries, along with tools for Arrow integration and interoperability
    with pandas, NumPy, and other software in the Python ecosystem.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Use of Uninitialized
    Variable. It was discovered that the C++ implementation (which underlies
    the R, Python and Ruby implementations) of Apache Arrow has an
    uninitialized memory bug when building arrays with null values in some
    cases. This can lead to uninitialized memory being unintentionally
    shared if Arrow Arrays are transmitted over the wire (for instance with
    Flight) or persisted in the streaming IPC and file formats.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Use of Uninitialized
    Variable. Leaves memory Array data uninitialized when reading RLE null
    data from parquet. This affected the C++, Python, Ruby and R
    implementations. The uninitialized memory could potentially be shared if
    are transmitted over the wire (for instance with Flight) or persisted in
    the streaming IPC and file formats.
