  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    Affected versions of [`pyxtrlock`][1] are vulnerable to Access
    Restriction Bypass. pyxtrlock before 0.1 uses an incorrect variable
    name, which allows physically proximate attackers to bypass the lock
    screen via multiple failed authentication attempts, which trigger a
    crash.

  description: |
    Affected versions of [`pyxtrlock`][1] are vulnerable to Access
    Restriction Bypass. pyxtrlock before 0.2 does not properly check the
    return values of the (1) xcb\_grab\_pointer and (2) xcb\_grab\_keyboard
    XCB library functions, which allows physically proximate attackers to
    gain access to the keyboard or mouse without unlocking the screen via
    unspecified vectors.
