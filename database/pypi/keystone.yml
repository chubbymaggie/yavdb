  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [`keystone`][1] is a very simple web framework

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation. The LDAP backend in OpenStack Identity (Keystone) Grizzly
    and Havana, when removing a role on a tenant for a user who does not
    have that role, adds the role to the user, which allows local users to
    gain privileges.
