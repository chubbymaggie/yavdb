  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [`python-swiftclient`][1] is a OpenStack Object Storage API Client
    Library.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM) attacks. The OpenStack Python client library for Swift
    (python-swiftclient) 1.0 through 1.9.0 does not verify X.509
    certificates from SSL servers, which allows man-in-the-middle attackers
    to spoof servers and obtain sensitive information via a crafted
    certificate.
