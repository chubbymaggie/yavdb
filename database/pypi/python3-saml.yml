  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |+
    [`python3-saml`][1] adds SAML support to Python software.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. It incorrectly utilizes the results of XML DOM traversal and
    canonicalization APIs in such a way that an attacker may be able to
    manipulate the SAML data without invalidating the cryptographic
    signature, allowing the attack to potentially bypass authentication to
    SAML service providers.



    [1]: https://www.npmjs.com/package/python3-saml
    \nSecurity Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML-based markup
    language for security assertions regarding authentication and
    permissions, most commonly used for single sign-on (SSO) services.

    Some XML DOM traversal and canonicalization APIs may be inconsistent in
    handling of comments within XML nodes. Incorrect use of these APIs by
    some SAML libraries results in incorrect parsing of the inner text of
    XML nodes such that any inner text after the comment is lost prior to
    cryptographically signing the SAML message. Text after the comment
    therefore has no impact on the signature on the SAML message.

    A remote attacker can modify SAML content for a SAML service provider
    without invalidating the cryptographic signature, which may allow
    attackers to bypass primary authentication for the affected SAML service
    provider.
