  title: "[CVE-2016-6581]  Resource Management Errors"
  description: A HTTP/2 implementation built using any version of the Python HPACK
    library between v1.0.0 and v2.2.0 could be targeted for a denial of service attack,
    specifically a so-called "HPACK Bomb" attack. This attack occurs when an attacker
    inserts a header field that is exactly the size of the HPACK dynamic header table
    into the dynamic header table. The attacker can then send a header block that
    is simply repeated requests to expand that field in the dynamic table. This can
    lead to a gigantic compression ratio of 4,096 or better, meaning that 16kB of
    data can decompress to 64MB of data on the target machine.
