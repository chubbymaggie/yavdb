  title: Arbitrary Code Injection
  description: |
    [eve][1] is an open source Python REST API framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Injection via the `where` parameter in the `io/mongo/parser.py` file.

    User input generated queries were not fully traversed in the
    sanitization. Therefore, the blacklist for mongo queries could be
    bypassed, allowing an attacker to manipulate `$where` queries to their
    advantage.
