  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [`Twisted`][1] is an asynchronous networking framework written in Python
    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass. When specifying the trustRoot (CA store) for the HTTP client,
    Twisted did not respect the user\'s specification, and always used the
    default of the platform trust. This means that users attempting to use
    this feature to implement certificate pinning, or otherwise restrict the
    trust CAs would still have accepted any certificate signed by a CA.

  title: Open Redirect
  description: |
    [`twisted`][1] is an asynchronous networking framework written in
    Python.

    Affected versions of this package are is vulnerable to Open HTTP
    Redirects. It was discovered that python-twisted-web used the value of
    the Proxy header from HTTP requests to initialize the `HTTP_PROXY`
    environment variable for CGI scripts, which in turn was incorrectly used
    by certain HTTP client implementations to configure the proxy for
    outgoing HTTP requests. A remote attacker could possibly use this flaw
    to redirect HTTP requests performed by a CGI script to an
    attacker-controlled proxy via a malicious HTTP request.
