  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [`swauth`][1] is An alternative authentication system for Swift.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass. An issue was discovered in middleware.py in OpenStack Swauth
    through 1.2.0 when used with OpenStack Swift through 2.15.1. The Swift
    object store and proxy server are saving (unhashed) tokens retrieved
    from the Swauth middleware authentication mechanism to a log file as
    part of a GET URI. This allows attackers to bypass authentication by
    inserting a token into an X-Auth-Token header of a new request.
