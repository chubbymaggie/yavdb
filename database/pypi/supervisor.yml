  title: Arbitrary Command Execution
  description: |+
    [`supervisor`][1] is a client/server system that allows its users to
    monitor and control a number of processes on UNIX-like operating
    systems.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command
    Execution. A vulnerability has been found where an authenticated client
    can send a malicious XML-RPC request to `supervisord` that will run
    arbitrary shell commands on the server. The commands will be run as the
    same user as `supervisord`. Depending on how `supervisord` has been
    configured, this may be root.



    [1]: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/supervisor/
    \n* `supervisord` is the server component and is responsible for starting
      child processes, responding to commands from clients, and other
      commands.
    * `supervisorctl` is the command line component, providing a shell-like
      interface to the features provided by `supervisord`.

    `supervisord` can be configured to run an HTTP server on a TCP socket
    and/or a Unix domain socket. This HTTP server is how `supervisorctl`
    communicates with `supervisord`. If an HTTP server has been enabled, it
    will always serve both HTML pages and an XML-RPC interface. A
    vulnerability has been found where an authenticated client can send a
    malicious XML-RPC request to `supervisord` that will run arbitrary shell
    commands on the server. The commands will be run as the same user as
    `supervisord`. Depending on how `supervisord` has been configured, this
    may be root. This vulnerability can only be exploited by an
    authenticated client or if `supervisord` has been configured to run an
    HTTP server without authentication. If authentication has not been
    enabled, `supervisord` will log a message at the critical level every
    time it starts.
