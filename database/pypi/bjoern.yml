  title: WSGI Header Spoofing
  description: |
    [`bjoern`][1] is a fast Python WSGI server written in C.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to WSGI header
    spoofing. A malicious user could exploit this vulnerability by using an
    `_` character instead of a `-` in an HTTP header. In the WSGI environ,
    the `X-Auth-User` and the `X-Auth_User` headers are both converted to
    `HTTP_X_Auth_User`, allowing the attacker to bypass the protection. This
    vulnerability is related to [CVE-2014-3566][2]
