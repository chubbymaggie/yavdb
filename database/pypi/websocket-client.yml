  title: Insecure Randomness
  description: |
    [`websocket_client`][1] is a WebSocket client for python.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Randomness
    due to the using the `uuid.uuid4()` function which can produce
    predictable values and should not be used in security-sensitive context.

  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [`websocket-client`][1] is a WebSocket client for python.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Timing Attacks due
    to not comparing the HMAC hashes in constant time. A malicious user
    could guess the valid HMAC hash during the comparison time with an
    algorithm.
