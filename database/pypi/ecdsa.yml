  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [ecdsa][1] is a easy-to-use implementation of ECDSA cryptography
    (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm), implemented purely in
    Python, released under the MIT license.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Timing Attack.
    Practical recovery of the long-term private key generated by the library
    is possible under certain conditions. Leakage of bit-length of a scalar
    during scalar multiplication is possible on an elliptic curve which
    might allow practical recovery of the long-term private key.
