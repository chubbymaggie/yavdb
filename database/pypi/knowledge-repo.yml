  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [knowledge-repo][1] is focused on facilitating the sharing of knowledge
    between data scientists and other technical roles using data formats and
    tools that make sense in these professions.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. `knowledge-repo` read their configuration from the repository
    itself, by default from a python module called
    `knowledge_repo_config.py`. A malicious user with appropriate
    permissions could submit arbitrary code that will be executed at runtime
    on usersâ€™ machines, potentially leading to unwanted data loss,
    corruption or dissemination. With this change, only YAML configuration
    files will be read from the repository, mitigating this security
    vulnerability.
