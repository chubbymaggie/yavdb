  title: Malicious Package
  description: |+
    12 Python libraries were identified as malicious packages. `colourama`
    was financially-motivated and hijacked an infected users\' operating
    system clipboard, where it would scan every 500ms for a Bitcoin
    address-like string, which it would replace with the attacker\'s own
    Bitcoin address in an attempt to hijack Bitcoin payments/transfers made
    by an infected user.

    On October 13th, 2018 all of these packages have been removed from Pypi.
