- id: snykio:pypi:pycrypto:CVE-2018-6594
  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [pycrypto][1] is a collection of both secure hash functions (such as
    SHA256 and RIPEMD160), and various encryption algorithms (AES, DES, RSA,
    ElGamal, etc.).

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Encryption,
    which can lead to Information Exposure.

    It generates weak `ElGamal` key parameters, which allows attackers to
    obtain sensitive information by reading ciphertext data (i.e., it does
    not have semantic security in face of a ciphertext-only attack). The
    Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption does not hold for PyCrypto\'s
    ElGamal implementation.
