  title: HTTP Response Splitting
  description: |
    [`webob`][1] is a WSGI request and response object.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to HTTP Response
    Splitting attacks. It is possible to set arbitrary headers in the HTTP
    response by embedding a \\r or \\n character in the header value, and
    sending it to the server.
