  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [`qpid_python`][1] is a Python client implementation and AMQP
    conformance tests for Apache Qpid.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    attacks due to hostname verification not turned on by default. When SSL
    or TLS connections are being established using default configuration, it
    would not verify the hostname of the connecting server and an attacker
    could easily establish a connection.
