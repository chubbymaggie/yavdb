    [pyro4][1] is a library that enables you to build applications in which
    objects can talk to eachother over the network, with minimal programming
    effort.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The `HMAC` encryption key used with the `-k` command line
    option was plainly visible.
