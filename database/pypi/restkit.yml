  title: Man-in-the-Middle (MitM)
  description: |
    [`restkit`][1] is a Python REST kit.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle
    (MitM) attacks due to not properly validate SSL/TLS certificates. It
    uses the `ssl.wrap_socket` function from the standard library, which
    does not do any validation by default.
