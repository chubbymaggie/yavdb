  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [marshmallow][1] is an ORM/ODM/framework-agnostic library for converting
    complex datatypes, such as objects, to and from native Python datatypes.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The schema `only` option treats an empty list as implying no
    `only` option, which allows a request that was intended to expose no
    fields to instead expose all fields.
