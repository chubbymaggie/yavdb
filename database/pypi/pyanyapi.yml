  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`pyanyapi`][1] is tools for convenient interface creation over various
    types of data in a declarative way.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. An exploitable vulnerability exists in the YAML parsing
    functionality in the YAMLParser method in Interfaces.py in PyAnyAPI
    before 0.6.1. A YAML parser can execute arbitrary Python commands
    resulting in command execution because load is used where safe\_load
    should have been used. An attacker can insert Python into loaded YAML to
    trigger this vulnerability.
