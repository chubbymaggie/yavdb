  title: Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
  description: |+
    [`web2py`][1] is a full-stack framework for rapid development and
    prototyping of secure database-driven web-based applications, written
    and programmable in Python.

    Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in static/js/share.js (aka the
    social bookmarking widget) in Web2py before 2.3.1 allows remote
    attackers to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via unspecified
    vectors.

    \nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker tricks a
    user’s browser to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a
    victim’s domain. Such scripts can steal the user’s session cookies for
    the domain, scrape or modify its content, and perform or modify actions
    on the user’s behalf, actions typically blocked by the browser’s Same
    Origin Policy.

    These attacks are possible by escaping the context of the web
    application and injecting malicious scripts in an otherwise trusted
    website. These scripts can introduce additional attributes (say, a
    \"new\" option in a dropdown list or a new link to a malicious site) and
    can potentially execute code on the clients side, unbeknown to the
    victim. This occurs when characters like `<` `>` `"` `'` are not escaped
    properly.

    There are a few types of XSS:

    * **Persistent XSS** is an attack in which the malicious code persists
      into the web app’s database.
    * **Reflected XSS** is an which the website echoes back a portion of the
      request. The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking a
      malicious link (for instance through a phishing email or malicious JS
      on another page), which triggers the XSS attack.
    * **DOM-based XSS** is an that occurs purely in the browser when
      client-side JavaScript echoes back a portion of the URL onto the page.
      DOM-Based XSS is notoriously hard to detect, as the server never gets
      a chance to see the attack taking place.

  title: Open Redirect
  description: |
    [web2py][1] is open source full-stack enterprise framework for agile
    development of secure database-driven web-based applications, written
    and programmable in Python.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect in
    `gluon/tools.py`. It allows remote attackers to redirect users to
    arbitrary web sites and conduct phishing attacks via a URL in the
    `_next` parameter to `user/logout`.

  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [web2py][1] is an open source full-stack enterprise framework for agile
    development of secure database-driven web-based applications, written
    and programmable in Python.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution. The `secure_load` function in `gluon/utils.py` uses
    `pickle.loads` to deserialize session information stored in cookies,
    which might allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by
    leveraging knowledge of encryption\_key.
