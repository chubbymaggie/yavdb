  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [planemo][1] is a command-line utilities library to assist in building
    tools for the Galaxy project.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Execution due to using the insecure `yaml.load()` function. Default
    behavior of PyYAML\'s `yaml.load()` method is unsafe and can execute
    code stored/provided in yaml files.
