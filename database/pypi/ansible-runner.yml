  description: |
    [ansible-runner][1] is a tool that helps when interfacing with Ansible
    directly or as part of another system whether that be through a
    container image interface, as a standalone tool, or as a Python module
    that can be imported.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Insecure Defaults.
    The default permissions of writing job events where not safe.
