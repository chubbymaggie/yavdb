  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    [`twilio`][1] is a Twilio API client and TwiML generator.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Timing Attacks.
    `twilio.util.RequestValidator` uses `==` to compare signatures, and this
    operation is designed to return a value as quickly as possible, meaning
    the signature check will take a variable amount of time based on how
    \"correct\" the submitted signature is. An attacker can use this timing
    information to determine the correct signature, one character at a time.
