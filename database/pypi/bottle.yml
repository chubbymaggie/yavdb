  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    [`bottle`][1] is a Fast and simple WSGI-framework for small
    web-applications. Bottle 0.10.x before 0.10.12, 0.11.x before 0.11.7,
    and 0.12.x before 0.12.6 does not properly limit content types, which
    allows remote attackers to bypass intended access restrictions via an
    accepted Content-Type followed by a ; (semi-colon) and a Content-Type
    that would not be accepted, as demonstrated in YouCompleteMe to execute
    arbitrary code.

  title: HTTP Response Splitting
  description: |
    [`bottle`][1] is a Fast and simple WSGI-framework for small
    web-applications. It was found that redirect() in bottle.py doesn\'t
    filter a \"\\r\\n\" sequence, which leads to a CRLF attack, as
    demonstrated by a redirect(\"233\\r\\nSet-Cookie: name=salt\") call.
