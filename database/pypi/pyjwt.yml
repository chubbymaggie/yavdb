  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    Affected versions of [`pyjwt`][1] are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass.

    In PyJWT 1.5.0 and below the `invalid_strings` check in
    `HMACAlgorithm.prepare_key` does not account for all PEM encoded public
    keys. Specifically, the PKCS1 PEM encoded format would be allowed
    because it is prefaced with the string `-----BEGIN RSA PUBLIC KEY-----`
    which is not accounted for. This enables symmetric/asymmetric key
    confusion attacks against users using the PKCS1 PEM encoded public keys,
    which would allow an attacker to craft JWTs from scratch.
