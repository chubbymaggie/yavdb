  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |
    [`borgbackup`][1] is a backup tool.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass by Spoofing the list of Archives. Borg (aka BorgBackup) before
    1.0.9 has a flaw in the cryptographic protocol used to authenticate the
    manifest (list of archives), potentially allowing an attacker to spoof
    the list of archives.

  title: Arbitrary File Overwrite
  description: |
    [`borgbackup`][1] is a backup tool.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File
    Overwrite. BorgBackup before 1.0.9 has a flaw in the way duplicate
    archive names were processed during manifest recovery, potentially
    allowing an attacker to overwrite an archive.

  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [`borgbackup`][1] is deduplicated, encrypted, authenticated and
    compressed backups.

    Affected versions of the package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass. Incorrect implementation of access controls allows remote users
    to override repository restrictions in Borg servers. A user able to
    access a remote Borg SSH server is able to circumvent access controls
    post-authentication.
