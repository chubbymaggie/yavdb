  title: Open Redirect
  description: |
    [httpie][1] is a command line HTTP client.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Open Redirect that
    allows an attacker to write an arbitrary file with supplied filename and
    content to the current directory, by redirecting a request from HTTP to
    a crafted URL pointing to a server in his or hers control. Depending on
    the context of using this command, this can lead to remote code
    execution and possibly privilege escalation.
