  title: Arbitrary Command Execution
  description: |
    [centreon/centreon][1] is a network, system, applicative supervision and
    monitoring tool.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Command
    Execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands by using
    the value \"init\_script\"-\"Monitoring Engine Binary\" in
    `main.get.php` to insert an arbitrary command into the database, and
    execute it by calling the vulnerable page
    `www/include/configuration/configGenerate/xml/generateFiles.php` (which
    passes the inserted value to the database to `shell_exec` without
    sanitizing it, allowing one to execute system arbitrary commands).
