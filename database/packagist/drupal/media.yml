  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [drupal/media][1] provides an extensible framework for managing files
    and multimedia assets, regardless of whether they are hosted on your own
    site or a 3rd party site.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). Some field types did not properly sanitize data from
    non-form sources. This can lead to arbitrary PHP code execution in some
    cases.
