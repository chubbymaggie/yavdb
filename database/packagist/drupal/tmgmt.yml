  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [drupal/tmgmt][1] is a collection of tools to facilitate the translation
    of text elements in Drupal.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). Some field types did not properly sanitize data from
    non-form sources. This can lead to arbitrary PHP code execution in some
    cases.
