  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    [drupal/workbench\_moderation][1] provides basic moderation support for
    revisionable content entities.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Access Restriction
    Bypass. It adds arbitrary moderation states to Drupal core\'s
    \"unpublished\" and \"published\" node states, and affects the behavior
    of node revisions when nodes are published.

    In some conditions, content moderation fails to check a users access to
    use certain transitions, leading to an access bypass.
