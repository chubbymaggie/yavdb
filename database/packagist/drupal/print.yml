  title: Remote Code Execution (RCE)
  description: |
    [drupal/print][1] allows to generate the following printer-friendly
    versions of any node:

    * Web page printer-friendly version (at [www.example.com/print/nid][2])
    * PDF version (at [www.example.com/printpdf/nid][3])
    * Send by-email (at [www.example.com/printmail/nid][4])

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution (RCE). It didn\'t sufficiently sanitize the arguments passed
    to the `wkhtmltopdf` executable, allowing a remote attacker to execute
    arbitrary shell commands. It also doesn\'t sufficiently sanitize the
    HTML content passed to `dompdf`, allowing a privileged attacker to
    execute arbitrary PHP code.
