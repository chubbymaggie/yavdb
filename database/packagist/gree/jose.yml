  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    Affected versions of [`gree/jose`][1] are vulnerable to Timing Attack.

    The library implemented a character to character comparison, similar to
    the built-in string comparison mechanism, `===`, and not a time constant
    string comparison. As a result, the comparison will fail faster when the
    first characters in the encryption key are incorrect. An attacker can
    use this difference to perform a timing attack, essentially allowing
    them to guess the encryption key one character at a time.

    You can read more about timing attacks in Node.js on the [Snyk blog][2].
