  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    Affected versions of [`aws/aws-sdk-php`][1] are vulnerable to Arbitrary
    Code Execution.

    Doctrine Annotations before 1.2.7, Cache before 1.3.2 and 1.4.x before
    1.4.2, Common before 2.4.3 and 2.5.x before 2.5.1, ORM before 2.4.8 or
    2.5.x before 2.5.1, MongoDB ODM before 1.0.2, and MongoDB ODM Bundle
    before 3.0.1 use world-writable permissions for cache directories, which
    allows local users to execute arbitrary PHP code with additional
    privileges by leveraging an application with the umask set to 0 and that
    executes cache entries as code.
