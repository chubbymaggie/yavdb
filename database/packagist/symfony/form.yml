  title: Timing Attack
  description: |
    Affected versions of [`symfony/form`][1] are vulnerable to Timing
    Attack.

    Symfony 2.3.x before 2.3.35, 2.6.x before 2.6.12, and 2.7.x before 2.7.7
    might allow remote attackers to have unspecified impact via a timing
    attack involving:

    * Symfony/Component/Security/Http/RememberMe/PersistentTokenBasedRememberMeServices
      or
    * Symfony/Component/Security/Http/Firewall/DigestAuthenticationListener
      class in the Symfony Security Component, or
    * legacy CSRF implementation from the
      Symfony/Component/Form/Extension/Csrf/CsrfProvider/DefaultCsrfProvider
      class in the Symfony Form component.

  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    Affected versions of [`symfony/form`][1] are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure.

    When a form is submitted by the user, the request handler classes of the
    Form component merge POST data (known as the `$_POST` array in plain
    PHP) and uploaded files data (known as the `$_FILES` array in plain PHP)
    into one array. This big array forms the data that are then bound to the
    form. At this stage there is no difference anymore between submitted
    POST data and uploaded files.

    A user can send a crafted HTTP request where the value of a FileType is
    sent as normal POST data that could be interpreted as a locale file path
    on the server-side (for example, file:///etc/passwd). If the application
    did not perform any additional checks about the value submitted to the
    FileType, the contents of the given file on the server could have been
    exposed to the attacker.
