  title: XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
  description: |+
    Affected versions of [`symfony/translation`][1] are vulnerable to XML
    External Entity (XXE) Injection.

    > Symfony 2.0.11 carried a \[similar\] XXE security fix, however, on
    > review of ZF2 I also noted a vulnerability to XML Entity Expansion
    > (XEE) attacks whereby all extensions making use of libxml2 have no
    > defense against XEE Quadratic Blowup Attacks. The vulnerability is a
    > function of there being no current method of disabling custom entities
    > in PHP (i.e. defined internal to the XML document without using
    > external entities). In a QBA, a long entity can be defined and then
    > referred to multiple times in document elements, creating a memory
    > sink with which Denial Of Service attacks against a host\'s RAM can be
    > mounted. The use of the LIBXML\_NOENT or equivalent option in a
    > dependent extension amplified the impact (it doesn\'t actually mean
    > \"No Entities\"). In addition, libxml2\'s innate defense against the
    > related Exponential or Billion Laugh\'s XEE attacks is active only so
    > long as the LIBXML\_PARSEHUGE is NOT set (it disables libxml2\'s
    > hardcoded entity recursion limit).

    \nXXE Injection is a type of attack against an application that parses XML
    input. XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding
    documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable.
    By default, many XML processors allow specification of an external
    entity, a URI that is dereferenced and evaluated during XML processing.
    When an XML document is being parsed, the parser can make a request and
    include the content at the specified URI inside of the XML document.

    Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive
    data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or
    relative paths in the system identifier.

    For example, below is a sample XML document, containing an XML element-
    username.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
           <username>John</username>
        </xml>

    An external XML entity - `xxe`, is defined using a system identifier and
    present within a DOCTYPE header. These entities can access local or
    remote content. For example the below code contains an external XML
    entity that would fetch the content of `/etc/passwd` and display it to
    the user rendered by `username`.

        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
        <!DOCTYPE foo [
           <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
           <username>&xxe;</username>
        </xml>

    Other XXE Injection attacks can access local resources that may not stop
    returning data, possibly impacting application availability and leading
    to Denial of Service.
