  title: CSV Injection
  description: |
    [phpmyfaq/phpmyfaq][1] is a FAQ system for PHP and MySQL, PostgreSQL and
    other databases

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to CSV Injection. CSV
    Injection, also known as Formula Injection, occurs when websites embed
    untrusted input inside CSV files. When a spreadsheet program is used to
    open a CSV, any cells starting with \'=\' will be interpreted by the
    software as a formula. Maliciously crafted formulas can be used for
    three key attacks:

    * Hijacking the user\'s computer by exploiting vulnerabilities in the
      spreadsheet software.
    * Hijacking the user\'s computer by exploiting the user\'s tendency to
      ignore security warnings in spreadsheets that they downloaded from
      their own website
    * Exfiltrating contents from the spreadsheet, or other open
      spreadsheets.
