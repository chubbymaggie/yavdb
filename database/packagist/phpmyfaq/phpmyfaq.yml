  title: CSV Injection
  description: |
    [phpmyfaq/phpmyfaq][1] is an Open Source FAQ system for PHP and MySQL,
    PostgreSQL and other databases.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to CSV Injection in
    reports.

    CSV Injection, also known as Formula Injection, occurs when websites
    embed untrusted input inside CSV files. When a spreadsheet program is
    used to open a CSV, any cells starting with \'=\' will be interpreted by
    the software as a formula. Maliciously crafted formulas can be used for
    three key attacks:

    * Hijacking the user\'s computer by exploiting vulnerabilities in the
      spreadsheet software.
    * Hijacking the user\'s computer by exploiting the user\'s tendency to
      ignore security warnings in spreadsheets that they downloaded from
      their own website
    * Exfiltrating contents from the spreadsheet, or other open
      spreadsheets.
