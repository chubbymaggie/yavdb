  title: Arbitrary Code Injection
  description: |
    [jsmitty12/phpwhois/phpwhois][1] is a library for querying whois
    services and parsing results.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary Code
    Injection due to insufficient sanitization of returned WHOIS data. An
    attacker who was controlling the `WHOIS` information of a requested
    domain could execute arbitrary PHP code in the context of the
    application.
