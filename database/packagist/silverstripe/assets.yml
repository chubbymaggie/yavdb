  title: Incorrect Access Control
  description: |
    [silverstripe/assets][1] is a asset module required component of
    SilverStripe Framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Incorrect Access
    Control. An permission issue was found within Silverstripe where using
    the Upload PHP API to upload files into a protected folder would set the
    file\'s visibility to public, rather than respecting its parent folder
    permissions.
