  title: Arbitrary File Upload
  description: |
    [slub/slub-events][1] is a TYPO3 extension for event registration and
    experts booking.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File
    Upload. The slub\_events (aka SLUB: Event Registration) extension used
    as part of TYPO3 allows uploading of arbitrary files to the webserver,
    resulting in the malicious upload and execution of malicious files on
    the server.

    It should be noted that for releases 1.2.2 and below, this can result in
    Remote Code Execution. In versions later than 1.2.2, this can result in
    Denial of Service, since the web space can be filled up with arbitrary
    files.
