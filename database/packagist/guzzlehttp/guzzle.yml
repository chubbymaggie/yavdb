  title: HTTP Request Redirection
  description: |
    Affected versions of [`guzzlehttp/guzzle`][1] are vulnerable to HTTP
    Proxy header vulnerability.

    PHP through 7.0.8 does not attempt to address RFC 3875 section 4.1.18
    namespace conflicts and therefore does not protect applications from the
    presence of untrusted client data in the `HTTP_PROXY` environment
    variable, which might allow remote attackers to redirect an
    application\'s outbound HTTP traffic to an arbitrary proxy server via a
    crafted Proxy header in an HTTP request, as demonstrated by (1) an
    application that makes a getenv(\'HTTP\_PROXY\') call or (2) a CGI
    configuration of PHP, aka an \"httpoxy\" issue.
