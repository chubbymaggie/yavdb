  title: Access Restriction Bypass
  description: |
    Affected versions of [`pusher/pusher-php-server`][1] are vulnerable to
    Exploit in the private channel authentication.

    `pusher` provides private channels with an authentication mechanism
    meant to restrict who can subscribe to these channels. End-users request
    a token from a special authentication endpoint, in order to join a
    particular channel. Due to a lack of validation in the authentication
    endpoint, a malicious end-user could submit a malformed `socket_id`
    field and have the customer unknowingly sign a string which grants
    access to the private channel even though the end-user appears to be
    requesting access to different private channel. In this way, a malicious
    end-user with permission to subscribe to one private channel is able to
    fake permission for any private channel owned by the same customer.
