  title: Privilege Escalation
  description: |
    [ezsystems/ezplatform][1] is a Meta repository that pulls in all
    dependencies for clean distribution of eZ Platform.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Privilege
    Escalation. The sample web server configuration in the documentation can
    in some cases allow the execution of uploaded `PHP/PHAR` code, which
    could lead to privilege escalation.
