  title: Arbitrary File Upload
  description: |
    [elefant/cms][1] is a refreshingly simple PHP content management system
    and web framework.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Arbitrary File
    Upload via the `apps/filemanager/handlers/upload/drop.php` method. A
    malicious user could upload an executable file due to decoding file
    names after restricting extensions.
