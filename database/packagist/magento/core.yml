  description: |+
    [magento/core][1] is a release of the Magento Community Edition.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting
    (XSS).



    [1]: https://packagist.org/packages/magento/core
    \nCross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks occur when an attacker tricks a
    user’s browser to execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of a
    victim’s domain. Such scripts can steal the user’s session cookies for
    the domain, scrape or modify its content, and perform or modify actions
    on the user’s behalf, actions typically blocked by the browser’s Same
    Origin Policy.

    These attacks are possible by escaping the context of the web
    application and injecting malicious scripts in an otherwise trusted
    website. These scripts can introduce additional attributes (say, a
    \"new\" option in a dropdown list or a new link to a malicious site) and
    can potentially execute code on the clients side, unbeknown to the
    victim. This occurs when characters like `<` `>` `"` `'` are not escaped
    properly.

    There are a few types of XSS:

    * **Persistent XSS** is an attack in which the malicious code persists
      into the web app’s database.
    * **Reflected XSS** is an which the website echoes back a portion of the
      request. The attacker needs to trick the user into clicking a
      malicious link (for instance through a phishing email or malicious JS
      on another page), which triggers the XSS attack.
    * **DOM-based XSS** is an that occurs purely in the browser when
      client-side JavaScript echoes back a portion of the URL onto the page.
      DOM-Based XSS is notoriously hard to detect, as the server never gets
      a chance to see the attack taking place.

    [magento/core][1] is a release of the Magento Community Edition.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting
    (XSS). An administrator on Magento 1 with permissions to edit CMS pages
    can insert script tags into the version history label which will trigger
    when another administrator previews a page which is standard practice
    prior to publishing content updates. The malicious script tag does not
    need to be the most recent entry, it just needs to exist in the history.
    As such a malicious actor would be able to insert the bad label in the
    non-current entry to avoid suspicion as this would not be obvious. This
    could then sit for some time until an administrator comes to preview the
    cms page before making an edit, allowing the malicious actor to perform
    actions as that user and gain additional privileges.
