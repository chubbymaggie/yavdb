  title: Arbitrary Code Execution
  description: |
    Affected versions of [`phpunit/phpunit`][1] are vulnerable to Arbitrary
    Code Execution.

    Usually, `phpunit` is deployed using composer, a very popular dependency
    manager for PHP. In most cases `phpunit` isn\'t required for the
    production environment, but nonetheless it is installed. Placing
    composer modules into web accessible directory is another common mistake
    that allows direct exploitation of this vulnerability.

    Vulnerability is located in `/phpunit/src/Util/PHP/eval-stdin.php` file.
    Before patch this file contained:

        eval('?>'.file_get_contents('php://input'));

    that could be used to run arbitrary PHP code.
