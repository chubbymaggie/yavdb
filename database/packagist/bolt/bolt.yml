  title: Remote Code Execution
  description: |
    [bolt/bolt][1] is a sophisticated, lightweight &amp; simple CMS.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Remote Code
    Execution. `Controller/Async/FilesystemManager.php` in the filemanager
    allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary PHP code by renaming a
    previously uploaded file to have a `.php` extension.

  title: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  description: |
    [bolt/bolt][1] is a sophisticated, lightweight &amp; simple CMS.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Cross-Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF). By deceiving an authenticated privileged user into
    clicking on a crafted URL, it is possible to steal the user\'s CSRF
    token and use it to perform harmful operations by uploading a malicious
    JavaScript file. The obtained token can be used to edit the
    `/edit/config/config.yml` configuration file within the CMS platform to
    then execute arbitrary code by uploading a PHP extension with malicious
    code.
