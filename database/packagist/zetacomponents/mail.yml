  title: SQL Injection
  description: |
    Affected versions of [`zetacomponents/mail`][1] are vulnerable to
    Arbitrary Code Execution.

    A malicious user may pass arbitrary parameters to the `sendmail` binary
    when setting the returnPath property of `ezcMail` when using the
    `ezcMailMtaTransport`. In some situations, it is possible to use an
    e-mail address that contains `-X/path/to/wwwroot/file.php"` to write a
    file to the file system, that can then be accessed and run through
    `domainname/file.php`.

    This is only possible if all of these conditions are true:

    * you use the ezcMailMtaTransport
    * your \"sendmail\" binary allows the -X flag to be set, which is not
      the case for exim4 and postfix, as they don\'t support that argument
    * your wwwroot is writable by the user your webserver is running at
    * the input to use for the ezcMailAddress that is assigned to the
      returnPath property is not properly escaped
