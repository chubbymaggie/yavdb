    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. An incorrect check of return values in the signature validation
    utilities allows an attacker to get invalid signatures accepted as valid

    \nSecurity Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML-based markup
    language for security assertions regarding authentication and

    Some XML DOM traversal and canonicalization APIs may be inconsistent in
    handling of comments within XML nodes. Incorrect use of these APIs by
    some SAML libraries results in incorrect parsing of the inner text of
    XML nodes such that any inner text after the comment is lost prior to
    cryptographically signing the SAML message. Text after the comment
    therefore has no impact on the signature on the SAML message.

  title: Authentication Bypass
  description: |+
    [simplesamlphp/saml2][1] is an application written in native PHP that
    deals with authentication.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Authentication
    Bypass. An incorrect check of return values in the signature validation
    utilities allows an attacker to get invalid signatures accepted as valid
    by forcing an error during validation.

    \nSecurity Assertion Markup Language (SAML) is an XML-based markup
    language for security assertions regarding authentication and

    Some XML DOM traversal and canonicalization APIs may be inconsistent in
    handling of comments within XML nodes. Incorrect use of these APIs by
    some SAML libraries results in incorrect parsing of the inner text of
    XML nodes such that any inner text after the comment is lost prior to
    cryptographically signing the SAML message. Text after the comment
    therefore has no impact on the signature on the SAML message.

    A remote attacker can modify SAML content for a SAML service provider
    without invalidating the cryptographic signature, which may allow

    \nDenial of Service (DoS) describes a family of attacks, all aimed at
    making a system inaccessible to its intended and legitimate users.

    Unlike other vulnerabilities, DoS attacks usually do not aim at
    breaching security. Rather, they are focused on making websites and
    services unavailable to genuine users resulting in downtime.

    One popular Denial of Service vulnerability is DDoS (a Distributed
    Denial of Service), an attack that attempts to clog network pipes to the
    system by generating a large volume of traffic from many machines.

    When it comes to open source libraries, DoS vulnerabilities allow
    attackers to trigger such a crash or crippling of the service by using a
    flaw either in the application code or from the use of open source
    libraries.

    Two common types of DoS vulnerabilities:

    * High CPU/Memory Consumption- An attacker sending crafted requests that
      could cause the system to take a disproportionate amount of time to
      process. For example,
      [commons-fileupload:commons-fileupload](SNYK-JAVA-COMMONSFILEUPLOAD-30082).

    * Crash - An attacker sending crafted requests that could cause the
      system to crash. For Example, [npm `ws` package](npm:ws:20171108)
