    Potential XSS Exploit When Binding `tagName` to User-Supplied Data

    This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2013-4170.

    In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content
    before inserting it in strings that will be sent to innerHTML.
    However, the `tagName` property of an `Ember.View` was inserted into
    such a string without being sanitized. This means that if an
    application assigns a view's `tagName` to user-supplied data, a
    specially-crafted payload could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the
    context of the current domain ("XSS").

    Versions Affected: ALL versions

    Fixed Versions: 1.0.0 RC6.1, 1.0.0 RC5.1, 1.0.0 RC4.1, 1.0.0 RC3.1,

    Potential XSS Exploit With User-Supplied Data When Binding Primitive Values

    This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE identifier CVE-2014-0013.

    In general, Ember.js escapes or strips any user-supplied content before
    inserting it in strings that will be sent to innerHTML.  However, we have
    identified a vulnerability that could lead to unescaped content being inserted
    into the innerHTML string without being sanitized.

    When a primitive value is used as the Handlebars context, that value is not
    properly escaped.  An example of this would be using the `{{each}}` helper to
    iterate over an array of user-supplied strings and using `{{this}}` inside the
    block to display each string.

    In applications that contain templates whose context is a primitive value and
    use the `{{this}}` keyword to display that value, a specially-crafted payload
    could execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the current domain
    ("XSS").
