  title: Information Exposure
  description: |
    [craftcms/cms][1] is a content management system.

    Affected versions of this package are vulnerable to Information
    Exposure. The parameter `preserveExifData` wasn\'t present in image
    uploads so EXIF data from user-uploaded images were potentially exposing
    personal/geolocation data to the public.
